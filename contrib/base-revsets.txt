# Base Revsets to be used with revsetbenchmarks.py script
#
# The goal of this file is to gather a limited amount of revsets that allow a
# good coverage of the internal revsets mechanisms.  Revsets included should not
# be selected for their individual implementation, but for what they reveal of
# the internal implementation of smartsets classes (and their interactions).
#
# Use and update this file when you change internal implementation of these
# smartsets classes. Please include a comment explaining what each of your
# addition is testing. Also check if your changes to the smartset class makes
# some of the tests inadequate and replace them with a new one testing the same
# behavior.
#
# If you want to benchmark revsets predicate itself, check 'all-revsets.txt'.
#
# The current content of this file is currently likely not reaching this goal
# entirely, feel free, to audit its content and comment on each revset to
# highlight what internal mechanisms they test.
