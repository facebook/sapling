    <h1>Mercurial version 0.9 for Windows</h1>

    <p>Welcome to Mercurial for Windows!</p>

    <p>Mercurial is a command-line application.  You must run it from
      the Windows command prompt (or if you're hard core, a <a
      href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> shell).</p>
    
    <p><div class="indented"><i>Note: the standard <a
      href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> msys startup script uses
      rxvt which has problems setting up standard input and output.
      Running bash directly works correctly.</i></div>

    <p>For documentation, please visit the <a
      href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial">Mercurial web site</a>.</p>

    <p>By default, Mercurial installs to <tt>C:\Mercurial</tt>.  The
      Mercurial command is called <tt>hg.exe</tt>.  To run this
      command, the install directory must be in your search path.</p>

    <h2>Setting your search path temporarily</h2>

    <p>To set your search path temporarily, type the following into a
      command prompt window:</p>

    <pre>
set PATH=C:\Mercurial;%PATH%
</pre>

    <h2>Setting your search path permanently</h2>

    <p>To set your search path permanently, perform the following
      steps.  These instructions are for Windows NT, 2000 and XP.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Open the Control Panel.  Under Windows XP, select the
	"Classic View".</li>

      <li>Double-click on the "System" control panel.</li>

      <li>Click on the "Advanced" tab.</li>

      <li>Click on "Environment Variables".  You'll find this near the
	bottom of the window.</li>

      <li>Under "System variables", you will see "Path".  Double-click
	it.</li>

      <li>Edit "Variable value".  Each path element is separated by a
	semicolon (";") character.  Append a semicolon to the end of the
	list, followed by the path where you installed Mercurial
	(e.g. <tt>C:\Mercurial</tt>).</li>

      <li>Click on the various "OK" buttons until you've completely
	exited from the System control panel.</li>

      <li>Log out and log back in, or restart your system.</li>

      <li>The next time you run the Windows command prompt, you will be
	able to run the <tt>hg</tt> command without any special
	help.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Testing Mercurial after you've installed it</h1>

    <p>The easiest way to check that Mercurial is installed properly is to
      just type the following at the command prompt:</p>

    <pre>
hg
</pre>

    <p>This command should print a useful help message.  If it does,
      other Mercurial commands should work fine for you.</p>

    <h1>Configuration notes</h1>
    <p>The default editor for commit messages is 'vi'. You can set the EDITOR
    (or HGEDITOR) environment variable to specify your preference or set it in
    mercurial.ini:</p>
    <pre>
[ui]
editor = whatever
</pre>
