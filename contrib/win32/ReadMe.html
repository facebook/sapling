    <h1>Mercurial for Windows</h1>

    <p>Welcome to Mercurial for Windows!</p>

    <p>
      Mercurial is a command-line application. You must run it from
      the Windows command prompt (or if you're hard core, a <a
      href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> shell).
    </p>

    <p class="indented">
      <i>Note: the standard <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a>
      msys startup script uses rxvt which has problems setting up
      standard input and output. Running bash directly works
      correctly.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      For documentation, please visit the <a
      href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial web site</a>.
      You can also download a free book, <a
      href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/">Mercurial: The Definitive
      Guide</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default, Mercurial installs to <tt>C:\Program
      Files\Mercurial</tt>. The Mercurial command is called
      <tt>hg.exe</tt>.
    </p>

    <h1>Testing Mercurial after you've installed it</h1>

    <p>
      The easiest way to check that Mercurial is installed properly is
      to just type the following at the command prompt:
    </p>

    <pre>
hg
</pre>

    <p>
      This command should print a useful help message. If it does,
      other Mercurial commands should work fine for you.
    </p>

    <h1>Configuration notes</h1>
    <h4>Default editor</h4>
    <p>
      The default editor for commit messages is 'notepad'. You can set
      the <tt>EDITOR</tt> (or <tt>HGEDITOR</tt>) environment variable
      to specify your preference or set it in <tt>mercurial.ini</tt>:
    </p>
    <pre>
[ui]
editor = whatever
</pre>

    <h4>Configuring a Merge program</h4>
    <p>
      It should be emphasized that Mercurial by itself doesn't attempt
      to do a Merge at the file level, neither does it make any
      attempt to Resolve the conflicts.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default, Mercurial will use the merge program defined by the
      <tt>HGMERGE</tt> environment variable, or uses the one defined
      in the <tt>mercurial.ini</tt> file. (see <a
      href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MergeProgram">MergeProgram</a>
      on the Mercurial Wiki for more information)
