    <h1>Mercurial for Windows</h1>

    <p>Welcome to Mercurial for Windows!</p>

    <p>Mercurial is a command-line application.  You must run it from
      the Windows command prompt (or if you're hard core, a <a
      href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> shell).</p>

    <p><div class="indented"><i>Note: the standard <a
      href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> msys startup script uses
      rxvt which has problems setting up standard input and output.
      Running bash directly works correctly.</i></div>

    <p>For documentation, please visit the <a
      href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial">Mercurial web site</a>.
      You can also download a free book, <a
      href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/">Distributed revision control
      with Mercurial</a>.</p>

    <p>By default, Mercurial installs to <tt>C:\Program Files\Mercurial</tt>.  The
      Mercurial command is called <tt>hg.exe</tt>.</p>

    <h1>Testing Mercurial after you've installed it</h1>

    <p>The easiest way to check that Mercurial is installed properly is to
      just type the following at the command prompt:</p>

    <pre>
hg
</pre>

    <p>This command should print a useful help message.  If it does,
      other Mercurial commands should work fine for you.</p>

    <h1>Configuration notes</h1>
	<h4>Default editor</h4>
	The default editor for commit messages is 'notepad'. You can set the EDITOR
    (or HGEDITOR) environment variable to specify your preference or set it in
    mercurial.ini:
    <pre>
[ui]
editor = whatever
</pre>

	<h4>Configuring a Merge program</h4>
	It should be emphasized that Mercurial by itself doesn't attempt to do a
	Merge at the file level, neither does it make any attempt to Resolve the conflicts.

    By default, Mercurial will use the merge program defined by the HGMERGE environment
    variable, or uses the one defined in the mercurial.ini file. (see <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/MergeProgram">MergeProgram</a> on the Mercurial Wiki for more information)
