PatchReview Introduction                                  *patchreview-intro*

The Patch Review plugin allows easy single or multipatch code or diff reviews.

It opens each affected file in the patch or in a workspace diff in a diff view
in a separate tab.

VIM provides the |:diffpatch| and related commands to do single file reviews
but can not handle patch files containing multiple patches as is common with
software development projects. This plugin provides that missing
functionality.

It also improves on |:diffpatch|'s behavior of creating the patched files in
the same directory as original file which can lead to project workspace
pollution.

It does automatic diff generation for various version control systems by
running their diff command.

PatchReview Options                                     *patchreview-options*

  g:patchreview_patch = {string}
      Optional path to patch binary. PatchReview tries to locate patch on
      system path automatically. If the binary is not on system path, this
      option tell PatchReview the full path to the binary.  This option, if
      specified, overrides the default patch binary on the path.

    examples:
        (On Windows with Cygwin) >
           let g:patchreview_patch = 'c:\\cygwin\\bin\\patch.exe'
<
        (On *nix systems) >
           let g:patchreview_patch = '/usr/bin/gpatch'
<

  g:patchreview_filterdiff = {string}
      Optional path to filterdiff binary. PatchReview tries to locate
      filterdiff on system path automatically. If the binary is not on system
      path, this option tell PatchReview the full path to the binary.  This
      option, if specified, overrides the default filterdiff binary on the
      path.

     examples:
        (On Windows with Cygwin)
>
           let g:patchreview_filterdiff = 'c:\\cygwin\\bin\\filterdiff.exe'
<
        (On *nix systems)
>
           let g:patchreview_filterdiff = '/usr/bin/filterdiff'

PatchReview Usage                                          *patchreview-usage*
                                                                *:DiffReview*

  :DiffReview

    Perform a diff review in the current directory under version control.
    Currently supports Mercurial (hg), Subversion (svn), CVS, Bazaar (bzr) and
    Monotone.

                                                                *:PatchReview*

  :PatchReview patchfile_path [optional_source_directory]

    Perform a patch review in the current directory based on the supplied
