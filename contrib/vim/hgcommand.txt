2. CVSCommand Installation				*cvscommand-install*

The CVSCommand plugin comprises two files, cvscommand.vim and cvscommand.txt
(this file).  In order to install the plugin, place the cvscommand.vim file
into a plugin' directory in your runtime path (please see |add-global-plugin|
and |'runtimepath'|.

CVSCommand may be customized by setting variables, creating maps, and
specifying event handlers.  Please see |cvscommand-customize| for more
details.

This help file can be included in the VIM help system by copying it into a
'doc' directory in your runtime path and then executing the |:helptags|
command, specifying the full path of the 'doc' directory.  Please see
|add-local-help| for more details.

==============================================================================

3. CVSCommand Intro					*cvscommand*
							*cvscommand-intro*

The CVSCommand plugin provides global ex commands for manipulating
CVS-controlled source files.  In general, each command operates on the current
buffer and accomplishes a separate cvs function, such as update, commit, log,
and others (please see |cvscommand-commands| for a list of all available
commands).  The results of each operation are displayed in a scratch buffer.
Several buffer variables are defined for those scratch buffers (please see
|cvscommand-buffer-variables|).

The notion of "current file" means either the current buffer, or, in the case
of a directory buffer, the file on the current line within the buffer.

For convenience, any CVSCommand invoked on a CVSCommand scratch buffer acts as
though it was invoked on the original file and splits the screen so that the
output appears in a new window.

Many of the commands accept revisions as arguments.  By default, most operate
on the most recent revision on the current branch if no revision is specified
(though see |CVSCommandInteractive| to prompt instead).

Each CVSCommand is mapped to a key sequence starting with the <Leader>
keystroke.  The default mappings may be overridden by supplying different
mappings before the plugin is loaded, such as in the vimrc, in the standard
fashion for plugin mappings.  For examples, please see
|cvscommand-mappings-override|.

The CVSCommand plugin may be configured in several ways.  For more details,
please see |cvscommand-customize|.

==============================================================================

4. CVSCommand Manual					*cvscommand-manual*

4.1 CVSCommand commands					*cvscommand-commands*

CVSCommand defines the following commands:

|:CVSAdd|
|:CVSAnnotate|
|:CVSCommit|
|:CVSDiff|
|:CVSEdit|
|:CVSEditors|
|:CVSGotoOriginal|
|:CVSLog|
|:CVSRevert|
|:CVSReview|
|:CVSStatus|
|:CVSUnedit|
|:CVSUpdate|
|:CVSVimDiff|
|:CVSWatch|
|:CVSWatchAdd|
|:CVSWatchOn|
|:CVSWatchOff|
|:CVSWatchRemove|
|:CVSWatchers|

:CVSAdd							*:CVSAdd*

This command performs "cvs add" on the current file.  Please note, this does
not commit the newly-added file.

:CVSAnnotate						*:CVSAnnotate*

This command performs "cvs annotate" on the current file.  If an argument is
given, the argument is used as a revision number to display.  If not given an
argument, it uses the most recent version of the file on the current branch.
Additionally, if the current buffer is a CVSAnnotate buffer already, the
version number on the current line is used.

If the |CVSCommandAnnotateParent| variable is set to a non-zero value, the
version previous to the one on the current line is used instead.  This allows
one to navigate back to examine the previous version of a line.

The filetype of the CVSCommand scratch buffer is set to 'CVSAnnotate', to take
advantage of the bundled syntax file.


:CVSCommit[!]						*:CVSCommit*

If called with arguments, this performs "cvs commit" using the arguments as
the log message.

If '!' is used with no arguments, an empty log message is committed.

If called with no arguments, this is a two-step command.  The first step opens
a buffer to accept a log message.  When that buffer is written, it is
automatically closed and the file is committed using the information from that
log message.  The commit can be abandoned if the log message buffer is deleted
or wiped before being written.

Alternatively, the mapping that is used to invoke :CVSCommit (by default
<Leader>cc) can be used in the log message buffer to immediately commit.  This
is useful if the |CVSCommandCommitOnWrite| variable is set to 0 to disable the
normal commit-on-write behavior.

:CVSDiff						*:CVSDiff*

With no arguments, this performs "cvs diff" on the current file against the
current repository version.

With one argument, "cvs diff" is performed on the current file against the
specified revision.

With two arguments, cvs diff is performed between the specified
revisions of the current file.

This command uses the 'CVSCommandDiffOpt' variable to specify diff options.
If that variable does not exist, then 'wbBc' is assumed.  If you wish to have
no options, then set it to the empty string.

:CVSEdit						*:CVSEdit*

This command performs "cvs edit" on the current file.  Yes, the output buffer
in this case is almost completely useless.

:CVSEditors						*:CVSEditors*

This command performs "cvs edit" on the current file.

:CVSGotoOriginal					*:CVSGotoOriginal*

This command returns the current window to the source buffer, if the current
buffer is a CVS command output buffer.

:CVSGotoOriginal!

Like ":CVSGotoOriginal" but also executes :bufwipeout on all CVS command
output buffers for the source buffer.

:CVSLog							*:CVSLog*

Performs "cvs log" on the current file.

If an argument is given, it is passed as an argument to the "-r" option of
"cvs log".

:CVSRevert						*:CVSRevert*

Replaces the current file with the most recent version from the repository in
order to wipe out any undesired changes.

:CVSReview						*:CVSReview*

Retrieves a particular version of the current file.  If no argument is given,
the most recent version of the file on the current branch is retrieved.
Otherwise, the specified version is retrieved.

:CVSStatus						*:CVSStatus*

Performs "cvs status" on the current file.

:CVSUnedit						*:CVSUnedit*

Performs "cvs unedit" on the current file.  Again, yes, the output buffer here
is basically useless.

:CVSUpdate						*:CVSUpdate*

Performs "cvs update" on the current file.  This intentionally does not
automatically reload the current buffer, though vim should prompt the user to
do so if the underlying file is altered by this command.

:CVSVimDiff						*:CVSVimDiff*

With no arguments, this prompts the user for a revision and then uses vimdiff
to display the differences between the current file and the specified
revision.  If no revision is specified, the most recent version of the file on
the current branch is used.

With one argument, that argument is used as the revision as above.  With two
arguments, the differences between the two revisions is displayed using
vimdiff.

With either zero or one argument, the original buffer is used to perform the
vimdiff.  When the other buffer is closed, the original buffer will be
returned to normal mode.

Once vimdiff mode is started using the above methods, additional vimdiff
buffers may be added by passing a single version argument to the command.
There may be up to 4 vimdiff buffers total.

Using the 2-argument form of the command resets the vimdiff to only those 2
versions.  Additionally, invoking the command on a different file will close
the previous vimdiff buffers.

:CVSWatch						*:CVSWatch*

This command takes an argument which must be one of [on|off|add|remove].  The
command performs "cvs watch" with the given argument on the current file.

:CVSWatchAdd						*:CVSWatchAdd*

This command is an alias for ":CVSWatch add"

:CVSWatchOn						*:CVSWatchOn*

This command is an alias for ":CVSWatch on"

:CVSWatchOff						*:CVSWatchOff*

This command is an alias for ":CVSWatch off"

:CVSWatchRemove						*:CVSWatchRemove*

This command is an alias for ":CVSWatch remove"

:CVSWatchers						*:CVSWatchers*

This command performs "cvs watchers" on the current file.

4.2 Mappings						*cvscommand-mappings*

By default, a mapping is defined for each command.  These mappings execute the
default (no-argument) form of each command.

<Leader>ca CVSAdd
<Leader>cn CVSAnnotate
<Leader>cc CVSCommit
<Leader>cd CVSDiff
<Leader>ce CVSEdit
<Leader>ci CVSEditors
<Leader>cg CVSGotoOriginal
<Leader>cG CVSGotoOriginal!
<Leader>cl CVSLog
<Leader>cr CVSReview
<Leader>cs CVSStatus
<Leader>ct CVSUnedit
<Leader>cu CVSUpdate
<Leader>cv CVSVimDiff
<Leader>cwv CVSWatchers
<Leader>cwa CVSWatchAdd
<Leader>cwn CVSWatchOn
<Leader>cwf CVSWatchOff
<Leader>cwf CVSWatchRemove

						*cvscommand-mappings-override*

The default mappings can be overriden by user-provided instead by mapping to
<Plug>CommandName.  This is especially useful when these mappings collide with
other existing mappings (vim will warn of this during plugin initialization,
but will not clobber the existing mappings).

For instance, to override the default mapping for :CVSAdd to set it to '\add',
add the following to the vimrc:

nmap \add <Plug>CVSAdd

4.3 Automatic buffer variables			*cvscommand-buffer-variables*

Several buffer variables are defined in each CVSCommand result buffer.	These
may be useful for additional customization in callbacks defined in the event
handlers (please see |cvscommand-events|).

The following variables are automatically defined:

b:cvsOrigBuffNR						*b:cvsOrigBuffNR*

This variable is set to the buffer number of the source file.

b:cvscmd						*b:cvscmd*

This variable is set to the name of the cvs command that created the result
buffer.
==============================================================================

5. Configuration and customization			*cvscommand-customize*
							*cvscommand-config*

The CVSCommand plugin can be configured in two ways:  by setting configuration
variables (see |cvscommand-options|) or by defining CVSCommand event handlers
(see |cvscommand-events|).  Additionally, the CVSCommand plugin provides
several option for naming the CVS result buffers (see |cvscommand-naming|) and
supported a customized status line (see |cvscommand-statusline| and
|cvscommand-buffer-management|).

5.1 CVSCommand configuration variables			*cvscommand-options*

Several variables affect the plugin's behavior.  These variables are checked
at time of execution, and may be defined at the window, buffer, or global
level and are checked in that order of precedence.


The following variables are available:

|CVSCommandAnnotateParent|
|CVSCommandCommitOnWrite|
|CVSCommandCVSExec|
|CVSCommandDeleteOnHide|
|CVSCommandDiffOpt|
|CVSCommandDiffSplit|
|CVSCommandEdit|
|CVSCommandEnableBufferSetup|
|CVSCommandInteractive|
|CVSCommandNameMarker|
|CVSCommandNameResultBuffers|
|CVSCommandSplit|

CVSCommandAnnotateParent			*CVSCommandAnnotateParent*

This variable, if set to a non-zero value, causes the zero-argument form of
CVSAnnotate when invoked on a CVSAnnotate buffer to go to the version previous
to that displayed on the current line.  If not set, it defaults to 0.

CVSCommandCommitOnWrite				*CVSCommandCommitOnWrite*

This variable, if set to a non-zero value, causes the pending cvs commit
to take place immediately as soon as the log message buffer is written.
If set to zero, only the CVSCommit mapping will cause the pending commit to
occur.	If not set, it defaults to 1.

CVSCommandCVSExec				*CVSCommandCVSExec*

This variable controls the executable used for all CVS commands  If not set,
it defaults to "cvs".

CVSCommandDeleteOnHide				*CVSCommandDeleteOnHide*

This variable, if set to a non-zero value, causes the temporary CVS result
buffers to automatically delete themselves when hidden.

CVSCommandDiffOpt				*CVSCommandDiffOpt*

This variable, if set, determines the options passed to the diff command of
CVS.  If not set, it defaults to 'wbBc'.

CVSCommandDiffSplit				*CVSCommandDiffSplit*

This variable overrides the |CVSCommandSplit| variable, but only for buffers
created with |:CVSVimDiff|.

CVSCommandEdit					*CVSCommandEdit*

This variable controls whether the original buffer is replaced ('edit') or
split ('split').  If not set, it defaults to 'edit'.

CVSCommandEnableBufferSetup			*CVSCommandEnableBufferSetup*

This variable, if set to a non-zero value, activates CVS buffer management
mode see (|cvscommand-buffer-management|).  This mode means that two buffer
variables, 'CVSRevision' and 'CVSBranch', are set if the file is
CVS-controlled.  This is useful for displaying version information in the
status bar.

CVSCommandInteractive				*CVSCommandInteractive*

This variable, if set to a non-zero value, causes appropriate commands (for
the moment, only |:CVSReview|) to query the user for a revision to use instead
of the current revision if none is specified.

CVSCommandNameMarker				*CVSCommandNameMarker*

This variable, if set, configures the special attention-getting characters
that appear on either side of the cvs buffer type in the buffer name.  This
has no effect unless |CVSCommandNameResultBuffers| is set to a true value.  If
not set, it defaults to '_'.  

CVSCommandNameResultBuffers			*CVSCommandNameResultBuffers*

This variable, if set to a true value, causes the cvs result buffers to be
named in the old way ('<source file name> _<cvs command>_').  If not set
or set to a false value, the result buffer is nameless.

CVSCommandSplit					*CVSCommandSplit*

This variable controls the orientation of the various window splits that
may occur (such as with CVSVimDiff, when using a CVS command on a CVS
command buffer, or when the |CVSCommandEdit| variable is set to 'split'.
If set to 'horizontal', the resulting windows will be on stacked on top of
one another.  If set to 'vertical', the resulting windows will be
side-by-side.  If not set, it defaults to 'horizontal' for all but
CVSVimDiff windows.

5.2 CVSCommand events				*cvscommand-events*

For additional customization, CVSCommand can trigger user-defined events.
Event handlers are provided by defining User event autocommands (see
|autocommand|, |User|) in the CVSCommand group with patterns matching the
event name.

For instance, the following could be added to the vimrc to provide a 'q'
mapping to quit a CVSCommand scratch buffer:

augroup CVSCommand
  au CVSCommand User CVSBufferCreated silent! nmap <unique> <buffer> q: bwipeout<cr>
augroup END

The following hooks are available:

CVSBufferCreated		This event is fired just after a cvs command
				result buffer is created and filled with the
				result of a cvs command.  It is executed within
				the context of the CVS command buffer.  The
				CVSCommand buffer variables may be useful for
				handlers of this event (please see
				|cvscommand-buffer-variables|).

CVSBufferSetup			This event is fired just after CVS buffer setup
				occurs, if enabled.

CVSPluginInit			This event is fired when the CVSCommand plugin
				first loads.

CVSPluginFinish			This event is fired just after the CVSCommand
				plugin loads.

CVSVimDiffFinish		This event is fired just after the CVSVimDiff
				command executes to allow customization of,
				for instance, window placement and focus.

5.3 CVSCommand buffer naming				*cvscommand-naming*

By default, the buffers containing the result of CVS commands are nameless
scratch buffers.  It is intended that buffer variables of those buffers be
used to customize the statusline option so that the user may fully control the
display of result buffers.

If the old-style naming is desired, please enable the
|CVSCommandNameResultBuffers| variable.  Then, each result buffer will receive
a unique name that includes the source file name, the CVS command, and any
extra data (such as revision numbers) that were part of the command.

5.4 CVSCommand status line support			*cvscommand-statusline*

It is intended that the user will customize the |'statusline'| option to
include CVS result buffer attributes.  A sample function that may be used in
the |'statusline'| option is provided by the plugin, CVSGetStatusLine().  In
order to use that function in the status line, do something like the
following:

set statusline=%<%f\ %{CVSGetStatusLine()}\ %h%m%r%=%l,%c%V\ %P

of which %{CVSGetStatusLine()} is the relevant portion.

The sample CVSGetStatusLine() function handles both CVS result buffers and
CVS-managed files if CVSCommand buffer management is enabled (please see
|cvscommand-buffer-management|).

5.5 CVSCommand buffer management		*cvscommand-buffer-management*

The CVSCommand plugin can operate in buffer management mode, which means that
it attempts to set two buffer variables ('CVSRevision' and 'CVSBranch') upon
entry into a buffer.  This is rather slow because it means that 'cvs status'
will be invoked at each entry into a buffer (during the |BufEnter|
autocommand).

This mode is disabled by default.  In order to enable it, set the
|CVSCommandEnableBufferSetup| variable to a true (non-zero) value.  Enabling
this mode simply provides the buffer variables mentioned above.  The user must
explicitly include those in the |'statusline'| option if they are to appear in
the status line (but see |cvscommand-statusline| for a simple way to do that).

==============================================================================

6. SSH "integration"					*cvscommand-ssh*

The following instructions are intended for use in integrating the
cvscommand.vim plugin with an SSH-based CVS environment.

Familiarity with SSH and CVS are assumed.

These instructions assume that the intent is to have a message box pop up in
order to allow the user to enter a passphrase.  If, instead, the user is
comfortable using certificate-based authentication, then only instructions
6.1.1 and 6.1.2 (and optionally 6.1.4) need to be followed; ssh should then
work transparently.

6.1 Environment settings				*cvscommand-ssh-env*

6.1.1 CVSROOT should be set to something like:

	:ext:user@host:/path_to_repository

6.1.2 CVS_RSH should be set to:

	ssh

	Together, those settings tell CVS to use ssh as the transport when
	performing CVS calls.

6.1.3 SSH_ASKPASS should be set to the password-dialog program.  In my case,
	running gnome, it's set to:

	/usr/libexec/openssh/gnome-ssh-askpass

	This tells SSH how to get passwords if no input is available.

6.1.4 OPTIONAL.  You may need to set SSH_SERVER to the location of the cvs
	executable on the remote (server) machine.

6.2 CVS wrapper program				*cvscommand-ssh-wrapper*

Now you need to convince SSH to use the password-dialog program.  This means
you need to execute SSH (and therefore CVS) without standard input.  The
following script is a simple perl wrapper that dissasociates the CVS command
from the current terminal.  Specific steps to do this may vary from system to
system; the following example works for me on linux.

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use POSIX qw(setsid);
open STDIN, '/dev/null';
fork and do {wait; exit;};
setsid;
exec('cvs', @ARGV);

6.3 Configuring cvscommand.vim			*cvscommand-ssh-config*

At this point, you should be able to use your wrapper script to invoke CVS with
various commands, and get the password dialog.  All that's left is to make CVS
use your newly-created wrapper script.

6.3.1 Tell cvscommand.vim what CVS executable to use.  The easiest way to do this
	is globally, by putting the following in your .vimrc:

	let CVSCommandCVSExec=/path/to/cvs/wrapper/script

6.4 Where to go from here			*cvscommand-ssh-other*

The script given above works even when non-SSH CVS connections are used,
except possibly when interactively entering the message for CVS commit log
(depending on the editor you use... VIM works fine).  Since the cvscommand.vim
plugin handles that message without a terminal, the wrapper script can be used
all the time.

This allows mixed-mode operation, where some work is done with SSH-based CVS
repositories, and others with pserver or local access.

It is possible, though beyond the scope of the plugin, to dynamically set the
CVS executable based on the CVSROOT for the file being edited.  The user
events provided (such as CVSBufferCreated and CVSBufferSetup) can be used to
set a buffer-local value (b:CVSCommandCVSExec) to override the CVS executable
on a file-by-file basis.  Alternatively, much the same can be done (less
automatically) by the various project-oriented plugins out there.

It is highly recommended for ease-of-use that certificates with no passphrase
or ssh-agent are employed so that the user is not given the password prompt
too often.

==============================================================================
9. Tips							*cvscommand-tips*

9.1 Split window annotation, by Michael Anderson

:nmap <Leader>cN :vs<CR><C-w>h<Leader>cn:vertical res 40<CR>
                 \ggdddd:set scb<CR>:set nowrap<CR><C-w>lgg:set scb<CR>
                 \:set nowrap<CR>

This splits the buffer vertically, puts an annotation on the left (minus the
header) with the width set to 40. An editable/normal copy is placed on the
right.  The two versions are scroll locked so they  move as one. and wrapping
is turned off so that the lines line up correctly. The advantages are...

1) You get a versioning on the right.
2) You can still edit your own code.
3) Your own code still has syntax highlighting.

==============================================================================

8. Known bugs						*cvscommand-bugs*

Please let me know if you run across any.

CVSUnedit may, if a file is changed from the repository, provide prompt text
to determine whether the changes should be thrown away.  Currently, that text
shows up in the CVS result buffer as information; there is no way for the user
to actually respond to the prompt and the CVS unedit command does nothing.  If
this really bothers anyone, please let me know.

CVSVimDiff, when using the original (real) source buffer as one of the diff
buffers, uses some hacks to try to restore the state of the original buffer
when the scratch buffer containing the other version is destroyed.  There may
still be bugs in here, depending on many configuration details.

vim:tw=78:ts=8:ft=help
