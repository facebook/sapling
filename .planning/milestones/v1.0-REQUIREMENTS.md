# Requirements: Sapling ISL Fork

**Defined:** 2025-01-21
**Core Value:** The UI should feel polished and effortless — you focus on the code, not fighting the interface.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Layout

- [x] **LAYOUT-01**: Three-column layout collapses gracefully on narrow screens (min-width threshold) — v1.0
- [x] **LAYOUT-02**: Proper spacing and padding throughout — UI has breathing room — v1.0

### Visual Style

- [x] **STYLE-01**: Overall color scheme matches Graphite aesthetic (navy backgrounds, soft colors, muted tones) — v1.0
- [x] **STYLE-02**: Diff highlighting uses Graphite colors (soft blue additions, salmon deletions) — v1.0

### PR Stack (Left Column)

- [x] **STACK-01**: Clicking a commit/PR checks it out (not just the pull button) — v1.0
- [x] **STACK-02**: "main" appears at top with pull/checkout button — v1.0
- [x] **STACK-03**: origin/main is visually highlighted — v1.0

### Commit Tree (Middle Column)

- [x] **TREE-01**: Selecting from left column auto-scrolls middle column to that commit — v1.0
- [x] **TREE-02**: Commits show author name and avatar — v1.0
- [x] **TREE-03**: origin/main is prominently highlighted — v1.0

### Details Panel (Right Column)

- [x] **DETAIL-01**: "Changes to amend" is de-emphasized (collapsible or moved below files) — v1.0
- [x] **DETAIL-02**: Files changed section is prominent — v1.0
- [x] **DETAIL-03**: Line counts show +X/-Y style (GitHub/Graphite) — v1.0 (total SLOC; +/- deferred)

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Stack Review Workflow

- **REVIEW-01**: Stack-specific review pain points (to be discovered through usage)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Upstream contribution | Internal fork, faster iteration without upstream constraints |
| Mobile support | Desktop/laptop is the target environment |
| New major features | Focus on UI polish first, discover needs through usage |
| Architectural changes | Work within existing ISL patterns |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| LAYOUT-01 | Phase 1 | Complete |
| LAYOUT-02 | Phase 1 | Complete |
| STYLE-01 | Phase 1 | Complete |
| STYLE-02 | Phase 5 | Complete |
