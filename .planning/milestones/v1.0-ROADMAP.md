# Milestone v1.0: Graphite-Style UI Polish

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-22
**Phases:** 1-5
**Total Plans:** 11

## Overview

Transform ISL from a functional but cramped interface into a polished, Graphite-inspired code review tool. The journey starts with responsive layout foundations, then systematically improves each of the three columns (stack, tree, details), culminating in diff color refinement. Each phase delivers visible improvements that the team can use immediately.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Layout & Foundation

**Goal**: Users see a responsive three-column layout with proper spacing and Graphite-inspired colors
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: LAYOUT-01, LAYOUT-02, STYLE-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Layout collapses gracefully when window is narrowed below threshold
  2. UI elements have visible breathing room (no cramped text or buttons)
  3. Color scheme uses Graphite-style navy backgrounds and muted tones
**Plans**: 3 plans (Wave 1 - all parallel)

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Responsive auto-collapse breakpoints (1200px details, 800px stack)
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Spacing and padding system for breathing room
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Graphite-style navy color scheme

### Phase 2: Stack Column

**Goal**: Users can navigate the PR stack by clicking commits/PRs to checkout
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: STACK-01, STACK-02, STACK-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Clicking any commit or PR in the stack checks it out (not just the pull button)
  2. "main" branch appears at top of stack with pull/checkout button
  3. origin/main is visually distinct from other items in the stack
**Plans**: 3 plans (Wave 1 - all parallel)

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Click-to-checkout on PR rows and stack cards
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Fixed main branch section at top with go-to-main action
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Origin/main visual highlighting in commit tree

### Phase 3: Commit Tree

**Goal**: Users see synchronized selection with author information in the commit tree
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: TREE-01, TREE-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Selecting from left column auto-scrolls middle column to that commit
  2. Each commit displays author name and avatar
  3. Selected commits have VS Code-style left border accent
**Plans**: 2 plans (Wave 1 - all parallel)

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Selection sync, auto-scroll, and VS Code-style selection border
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Author avatar display with initials fallback

### Phase 4: Details Panel

**Goal**: Users see file changes prominently with de-emphasized amend section
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: DETAIL-01, DETAIL-02, DETAIL-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. "Changes to amend" section is collapsed by default or below files
  2. Files changed section is visually prominent (larger, higher position)
  3. Line counts display as +X/-Y (GitHub/Graphite style)
**Plans**: 2 plans (Wave 1 - all parallel)

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Reorganize panel hierarchy (files up, amend collapsed)
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Line count visual enhancement

**Note:** Success criterion 3 (+X/-Y format) is constrained by backend data. Current implementation provides total SLOC only. Plan 02 enhances visual prominence; +/- format deferred until backend provides separate counts.

### Phase 5: Diff Polish

**Goal**: Users see diffs with Graphite-style color scheme
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: STYLE-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Additions use soft blue tint (not harsh green)
  2. Deletions use salmon/soft red (not harsh red)
  3. Overall diff view matches Graphite aesthetic (muted, easy on eyes)
**Plans**: 1 plan (Wave 1)

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Graphite-style diff colors (soft blue additions, salmon deletions)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Deep navy #1a1f36 as primary background (Graphite-style, professional, easy on eyes)
- Soft blue #4a90e2 as accent color (interactive elements stand out without being garish)
- Single-click checkout on entire PR row (matches Graphite UX pattern)
- DAG-based branch detection (use dagWithPreviews for real-time state)
- 12-color palette for author avatars (deterministic hash for consistency)
- Soft cyan-blue for diff additions, salmon for deletions (muted, easy on eyes)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Three-column layout cramping on smaller screens
- Navigation requiring hunting for small buttons
- Harsh diff colors causing eye strain
- Information density without breathing room

**Issues Deferred:**
- +X/-Y line count format (backend provides total SLOC only)
- v2 stack review workflow features (discover through usage)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None significant
