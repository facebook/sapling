// The various configs that should be applied on Mercurial clients. There are

// flexible configuration can overwrite the least flexible. So the order they
// are applied in will be:
// 1. features
// 2. hotfixes
// 3. lua
struct ClientConfig {

    // A feature is single condition that enables or disables a particular
    // feature in Mercurial. The actual configs for that feature are in the
    // client itself, and the feature flag only controls enabling or disabling
    // the feature, and will likely be controlled via automation.
    // Roughly equivalent to a Gatekeeper.
    // Ex: 2: map<string, Condition> features,

    // The features/hotfixes fields facilitate well structured configs and
    // easy changes via automation. In the future we may want to supplement or
    // replace it with more powerful raw lua configuration abilities.
    // Ex: 3: string lua_config,
