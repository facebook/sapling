"    If <REVMAP> isn't given, it will be put in a default location\n"
"    (<dest>/.hg/shamap by default).  The <REVMAP> is a simple text\n"
"    file that maps each source commit ID to the destination ID for\n"
"    that revision, like so:\n"
"    <source ID> <destination ID>\n"
"\n"
"    If the file doesn't exist, it's automatically created.  It's updated\n"
"    on each commit copied, so convert-repo can be interrupted and can\n"

"    commit author to a destination commit author. It is handy for source "
"SCMs\n"

"    contain one of the following directives:\n"
"\n"
"      include path/to/file\n"
"\n"
"      exclude path/to/file\n"
"\n"
"      rename from/file to/file\n"
"\n"
"    The 'include' directive causes a file, or all files under a\n"

"    exclusion of all other files and dirs not explicitely included.\n"
"    The 'exclude' directive causes files or directories to be omitted.\n"

"    subdirectory into the root of the repository, use '.' as the path to\n"
"    rename to.\n"
"\n"
"    The splicemap is a file that allows insertion of synthetic\n"
"    history, letting you specify the parents of a revision.  This is\n"
"    useful if you want to e.g. give a Subversion merge two parents, or\n"
"    graft two disconnected series of history together.  Each entry\n"
"    contains a key, followed by a space, followed by one or two\n"
"    values, separated by spaces.  The key is the revision ID in the\n"
"    source revision control system whose parents should be modified\n"
"    (same format as a key in .hg/shamap).  The values are the revision\n"
"    IDs (in either the source or destination revision control system)\n"
"    that should be used as the new parents for that node.\n"

"    Mercurial Source\n"
"    -----------------\n"
"\n"
"    --config convert.hg.ignoreerrors=False (boolean)\n"
"        ignore integrity errors when reading. Use it to fix Mercurial\n"
"        repositories with missing revlogs, by converting from and to\n"
"        Mercurial.\n"
"    --config convert.hg.saverev=True          (boolean)\n"
"        allow target to preserve source revision ID\n"
"    --config convert.hg.startrev=0            (hg revision identifier)\n"
"        convert start revision and its descendants\n"
"\n"
"    CVS Source\n"
"    ----------\n"
"\n"
"    CVS source will use a sandbox (i.e. a checked-out copy) from CVS\n"
"    to indicate the starting point of what will be converted. Direct\n"
"    access to the repository files is not needed, unless of course\n"
"    the repository is :local:. The conversion uses the top level\n"
"    directory in the sandbox to find the CVS repository, and then uses\n"
"    CVS rlog commands to find files to convert. This means that unless\n"
"    a filemap is given, all files under the starting directory will be\n"
"    converted, and that any directory reorganisation in the CVS\n"
"    sandbox is ignored.\n"
"\n"
"    Because CVS does not have changesets, it is necessary to collect\n"
"    individual commits to CVS and merge them into changesets. CVS\n"
"    source uses its internal changeset merging code by default but can\n"
"    be configured to call the external 'cvsps' program by setting:\n"
"        --config convert.cvsps='cvsps -A -u --cvs-direct -q'\n"
"    This is a legacy option and may be removed in future.\n"
"\n"
"    The options shown are the defaults.\n"
"\n"
"    Internal cvsps is selected by setting\n"
"        --config convert.cvsps=builtin\n"
"    and has a few more configurable options:\n"
"        --config convert.cvsps.fuzz=60   (integer)\n"
"            Specify the maximum time (in seconds) that is allowed between\n"
"            commits with identical user and log message in a single\n"
"            changeset. When very large files were checked in as part\n"
"            of a changeset then the default may not be long enough.\n"
"        --config convert.cvsps.mergeto='{{mergetobranch ([-\\w]+)}}'\n"
"            Specify a regular expression to which commit log messages are\n"
"            matched. If a match occurs, then the conversion process will\n"
"            insert a dummy revision merging the branch on which this log\n"
"            message occurs to the branch indicated in the regex.\n"
"        --config convert.cvsps.mergefrom='{{mergefrombranch ([-\\w]+)}}'\n"
"            Specify a regular expression to which commit log messages are\n"
"            matched. If a match occurs, then the conversion process will\n"
"            add the most recent revision on the branch indicated in the\n"
"            regex as the second parent of the changeset.\n"
"\n"
"    The hgext/convert/cvsps wrapper script allows the builtin changeset\n"
"    merging code to be run without doing a conversion. Its parameters and\n"
"    output are similar to that of cvsps 2.1.\n"
"\n"
"    Subversion Source\n"
"    -----------------\n"
"\n"
"    Subversion source detects classical trunk/branches/tags layouts.\n"
"    By default, the supplied \"svn://repo/path/\" source URL is\n"
"    converted as a single branch. If \"svn://repo/path/trunk\" exists\n"
"    it replaces the default branch. If \"svn://repo/path/branches\"\n"
"    exists, its subdirectories are listed as possible branches. If\n"
"    \"svn://repo/path/tags\" exists, it is looked for tags referencing\n"
"    converted branches. Default \"trunk\", \"branches\" and \"tags\" values\n"
"    can be overriden with following options. Set them to paths\n"
"    relative to the source URL, or leave them blank to disable\n"
"    autodetection.\n"
"\n"
"    --config convert.svn.branches=branches    (directory name)\n"
"        specify the directory containing branches\n"
"    --config convert.svn.tags=tags            (directory name)\n"
"        specify the directory containing tags\n"
"    --config convert.svn.trunk=trunk          (directory name)\n"
"        specify the name of the trunk branch\n"
"\n"
"    Source history can be retrieved starting at a specific revision,\n"
"    instead of being integrally converted. Only single branch\n"
"    conversions are supported.\n"
"\n"
"    --config convert.svn.startrev=0           (svn revision number)\n"
"        specify start Subversion revision.\n"
"\n"
"    Mercurial Destination\n"
"    ---------------------\n"
"\n"
"    --config convert.hg.clonebranches=False   (boolean)\n"
"        dispatch source branches in separate clones.\n"

"UNIX mbox files, i.e. with mutt:\n"

"    Mercurial accepts several notations for identifying one or more\n"
"    files at a time.\n"
"\n"
"    By default, Mercurial treats filenames as shell-style extended\n"
"    glob patterns.\n"
"\n"
"    Alternate pattern notations must be specified explicitly.\n"
"\n"
"    To use a plain path name without any pattern matching, start a\n"
"    name with \"path:\".  These path names must match completely, from\n"
"    the root of the current repository.\n"
"\n"
"    To use an extended glob, start a name with \"glob:\".  Globs are\n"
"    rooted at the current directory; a glob such as \"*.c\" will match\n"
"    files ending in \".c\" in the current directory only.\n"
"\n"
"    The supported glob syntax extensions are \"**\" to match any string\n"
"    across path separators, and \"{a,b}\" to mean \"a or b\".\n"
"\n"
"    To use a Perl/Python regular expression, start a name with \"re:\".\n"
"    Regexp pattern matching is anchored at the root of the repository.\n"
"\n"
"    Plain examples:\n"
"\n"
"    path:foo/bar   a name bar in a directory named foo in the root of\n"
"                   the repository\n"
"    path:path:name a file or directory named \"path:name\"\n"
"\n"
"    Glob examples:\n"
"\n"
"    glob:*.c       any name ending in \".c\" in the current directory\n"
"    *.c            any name ending in \".c\" in the current directory\n"
"    **.c           any name ending in \".c\" in the current directory, or\n"
