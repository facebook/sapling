"    that revision, like so:\n"
"    <source ID> <destination ID>\n"
"\n"
"    If the file doesn't exist, it's automatically created.  It's updated\n"

"SCMs\n"

"\n"
"      exclude path/to/file\n"
"\n"
"      rename from/file to/file\n"

"    useful if you want to e.g. give a Subversion merge two parents, or\n"
"    graft two disconnected series of history together.  Each entry\n"
"    contains a key, followed by a space, followed by one or two\n"
"    values, separated by spaces.  The key is the revision ID in the\n"
"    source revision control system whose parents should be modified\n"
"    (same format as a key in .hg/shamap).  The values are the revision\n"

"        repositories with missing revlogs, by converting from and to\n"
"        Mercurial.\n"

"        allow target to preserve source revision ID\n"
"    --config convert.hg.startrev=0            (hg revision identifier)\n"
"        convert start revision and its descendants\n"
"\n"
"    CVS Source\n"
"    ----------\n"
"\n"
"    CVS source will use a sandbox (i.e. a checked-out copy) from CVS\n"
"    to indicate the starting point of what will be converted. Direct\n"
"    access to the repository files is not needed, unless of course\n"
"    the repository is :local:. The conversion uses the top level\n"
"    directory in the sandbox to find the CVS repository, and then uses\n"
"    CVS rlog commands to find files to convert. This means that unless\n"
"    a filemap is given, all files under the starting directory will be\n"
"    converted, and that any directory reorganisation in the CVS\n"
"    sandbox is ignored.\n"
"\n"
"    Because CVS does not have changesets, it is necessary to collect\n"
"    individual commits to CVS and merge them into changesets. CVS\n"
"    source uses its internal changeset merging code by default but can\n"
"    be configured to call the external 'cvsps' program by setting:\n"
"        --config convert.cvsps='cvsps -A -u --cvs-direct -q'\n"
"    This is a legacy option and may be removed in future.\n"
"\n"
"    The options shown are the defaults.\n"
"\n"
"    Internal cvsps is selected by setting\n"
"        --config convert.cvsps=builtin\n"
"    and has a few more configurable options:\n"
"        --config convert.cvsps.fuzz=60   (integer)\n"
"            Specify the maximum time (in seconds) that is allowed between\n"
"            commits with identical user and log message in a single\n"
"            changeset. When very large files were checked in as part\n"
"            of a changeset then the default may not be long enough.\n"
"        --config convert.cvsps.mergeto='{{mergetobranch ([-\\w]+)}}'\n"
"            Specify a regular expression to which commit log messages are\n"
"            matched. If a match occurs, then the conversion process will\n"
"            insert a dummy revision merging the branch on which this log\n"
"            message occurs to the branch indicated in the regex.\n"
"        --config convert.cvsps.mergefrom='{{mergefrombranch ([-\\w]+)}}'\n"
"            Specify a regular expression to which commit log messages are\n"
"            matched. If a match occurs, then the conversion process will\n"
"            add the most recent revision on the branch indicated in the\n"
"            regex as the second parent of the changeset.\n"
"\n"
"    The hgext/convert/cvsps wrapper script allows the builtin changeset\n"
"    merging code to be run without doing a conversion. Its parameters and\n"
"    output are similar to that of cvsps 2.1.\n"
"\n"
"    Subversion Source\n"
"    -----------------\n"
"\n"
"    Subversion source detects classical trunk/branches/tags layouts.\n"
"    By default, the supplied \"svn://repo/path/\" source URL is\n"
"    converted as a single branch. If \"svn://repo/path/trunk\" exists\n"
"    it replaces the default branch. If \"svn://repo/path/branches\"\n"
"    exists, its subdirectories are listed as possible branches. If\n"
"    \"svn://repo/path/tags\" exists, it is looked for tags referencing\n"
"    converted branches. Default \"trunk\", \"branches\" and \"tags\" values\n"
"    can be overriden with following options. Set them to paths\n"
"    relative to the source URL, or leave them blank to disable\n"
"    autodetection.\n"
"\n"
"    --config convert.svn.branches=branches    (directory name)\n"
"        specify the directory containing branches\n"
"    --config convert.svn.tags=tags            (directory name)\n"
"        specify the directory containing tags\n"
"    --config convert.svn.trunk=trunk          (directory name)\n"
"        specify the name of the trunk branch\n"
"\n"
"    Source history can be retrieved starting at a specific revision,\n"
"    instead of being integrally converted. Only single branch\n"
"    conversions are supported.\n"
"\n"
"    --config convert.svn.startrev=0           (svn revision number)\n"
"        specify start Subversion revision.\n"
"\n"

"UNIX mbox files, i.e. with mutt:\n"

"\n"
"  % formail -s sendmail -bm -t < mbox\n"

"    仅当远程水银服务器显式启用时，才能推到 'http://' 和 'https://'。\n"
"\n"
"    在水银中使用 SSH 的一些提示:\n"
"    - 使用 SSH 时，需要在远程主机上有可登录帐号，远程路径中还需要有\n"
"      hg，或者有指定的远程命令。\n"
"    - 默认 'path' 是相对于远程主机上的用户家目录。\n"
"      可以在路径前增加一个斜线指定绝对路径:\n"
"        ssh://example.com//tmp/repository\n"
"    - 水银使用 SSH 时不使用压缩，所以你可以在 ~/.ssh/config 中配置\n"
"      SSH 执行压缩，例如:\n"
"        Host *.mylocalnetwork.example.com\n"
"          Compression no\n"
"        Host *\n"
"          Compression yes\n"
"      另一个方法是在你的 hgrc 中将 \"ssh -C\" 作为你的 ssh 命令，或\n"
"      用于命令行参数 '--ssh' 中。\n"
"\n"
"    这些路径可以在你的 'hgrc' 中的节 '[paths]' 中定义别名:\n"
"    [paths]\n"
"    alias1 = URL1\n"
"    alias2 = URL2\n"
"    ...\n"
"\n"
"    然后你就可以在任意命令中使用这些别名作为路径(例如 'hg pull alias1'\n"
"    会从 'alias1' 定义的路径取得指定版本)。\n"
"\n"
"    因为用于默认路径，所以这 2 个路径别名特别重要:\n"
"\n"
"    default:\n"
"      当你使用 'hg clone' 创建版本库时，此命令会将源版本库的路径保存\n"
"      为别名 'default'，然后你可以对命令 'push' 和 'pull' 省略路径。\n"
"\n"
"    default-push:\n"
"      命令 'push' 会查找别名是 'default-push' 的路径，它覆盖定义 'default'。\n"
