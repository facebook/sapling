"hooks for controlling repository access\n"
"\n"
"This hook makes it possible to allow or deny write access to portions\n"
"of a repository when receiving incoming changesets.\n"
"\n"
"The authorization is matched based on the local user name on the\n"
"system where the hook runs, and not the committer of the original\n"
"changeset (since the latter is merely informative).\n"
"\n"
"The acl hook is best used along with a restricted shell like hgsh,\n"
"preventing authenticating users from doing anything other than\n"
"pushing or pulling. The hook is not safe to use if users have\n"
"interactive shell access, as they can then disable the hook.\n"
"Nor is it safe if remote users share an account, because then there\n"
"is no way to distinguish them.\n"
"\n"
"To use this hook, configure the acl extension in your hgrc like this::\n"
"\n"
"  [extensions]\n"
"  acl =\n"
"\n"
"  [hooks]\n"
"  pretxnchangegroup.acl = python:hgext.acl.hook\n"

"syntax by default), and a comma separated list of users as the\n"

"track a line of development with movable markers\n"
"\n"
"Bookmarks are local movable markers to changesets. Every bookmark\n"

"hooks for integrating with the Bugzilla bug tracker\n"
"\n"
"This hook extension adds comments on bugs in Bugzilla when changesets\n"
"that refer to bugs by Bugzilla ID are seen. The hook does not change\n"
"bug status.\n"
"\n"
"The hook updates the Bugzilla database directly. Only Bugzilla\n"
"installations using MySQL are supported.\n"
"\n"
"The hook relies on a Bugzilla script to send bug change notification\n"
"emails. That script changes between Bugzilla versions; the\n"
"'processmail' script used prior to 2.18 is replaced in 2.18 and\n"
"subsequent versions by 'config/sendbugmail.pl'. Note that these will\n"
"be run by Mercurial as the user pushing the change; you will need to\n"
"ensure the Bugzilla install file permissions are set appropriately.\n"
"\n"
"The extension is configured through three different configuration\n"
"sections. These keys are recognized in the [bugzilla] section:\n"
"\n"
"host\n"
"  Hostname of the MySQL server holding the Bugzilla database.\n"
"\n"
"db\n"
"  Name of the Bugzilla database in MySQL. Default 'bugs'.\n"
"\n"
"user\n"
"  Username to use to access MySQL server. Default 'bugs'.\n"
"\n"
"password\n"
"  Password to use to access MySQL server.\n"
"\n"
"timeout\n"
"  Database connection timeout (seconds). Default 5.\n"
"\n"
"version\n"
"  Bugzilla version. Specify '3.0' for Bugzilla versions 3.0 and later,\n"
"  '2.18' for Bugzilla versions from 2.18 and '2.16' for versions prior\n"
"  to 2.18.\n"
"\n"
"bzuser\n"
"  Fallback Bugzilla user name to record comments with, if changeset\n"
"  committer cannot be found as a Bugzilla user.\n"
"\n"
"bzdir\n"
"   Bugzilla install directory. Used by default notify. Default\n"
"   '/var/www/html/bugzilla'.\n"
"\n"
"notify\n"
"  The command to run to get Bugzilla to send bug change notification\n"
"  emails. Substitutes from a map with 3 keys, 'bzdir', 'id' (bug id)\n"
"  and 'user' (committer bugzilla email). Default depends on version;\n"
"  from 2.18 it is \"cd %(bzdir)s && perl -T contrib/sendbugmail.pl\n"
"  %(id)s %(user)s\".\n"
"\n"
"regexp\n"
"  Regular expression to match bug IDs in changeset commit message.\n"
"  Must contain one \"()\" group. The default expression matches 'Bug\n"
"  1234', 'Bug no. 1234', 'Bug number 1234', 'Bugs 1234,5678', 'Bug\n"
"  1234 and 5678' and variations thereof. Matching is case insensitive.\n"
"\n"
"style\n"
"  The style file to use when formatting comments.\n"
"\n"
"template\n"
"  Template to use when formatting comments. Overrides style if\n"
"  specified. In addition to the usual Mercurial keywords, the\n"
"  extension specifies::\n"
"\n"
"    {bug}       The Bugzilla bug ID.\n"
"    {root}      The full pathname of the Mercurial repository.\n"

"strip\n"
"  The number of slashes to strip from the front of {root} to produce\n"
"  {webroot}. Default 0.\n"
"\n"
"usermap\n"
"  Path of file containing Mercurial committer ID to Bugzilla user ID\n"

"  line, \"committer\"=\"Bugzilla user\". See also the [usermap] section.\n"

"    By default, the supplied \"svn://repo/path/\" source URL is\n"
"    converted as a single branch. If \"svn://repo/path/trunk\" exists it\n"

"    converted branches. Default \"trunk\", \"branches\" and \"tags\" values\n"
"    can be overridden with following options. Set them to paths\n"
"    relative to the source URL, or leave them blank to disable auto\n"
"    detection.\n"
"\n"
"    --config convert.svn.branches=branches    (directory name)\n"

"    --config convert.svn.trunk=trunk          (directory name)\n"
"        specify the name of the trunk branch\n"
"\n"

"    instead of being integrally converted. Only single branch\n"
"    conversions are supported.\n"
"\n"
"    --config convert.svn.startrev=0           (svn revision number)\n"
"        specify start Subversion revision.\n"

"    ---------------\n"

"    and integrations. Note that when a depot path is given you then\n"
"    usually should specify a target directory, because otherwise the\n"
"    target may be named ...-hg.\n"
"\n"
"    It is possible to limit the amount of source history to be\n"

"Some notes about using SSH with Mercurial:\n"
"\n"
"- SSH requires an accessible shell account on the destination machine\n"
"  and a copy of hg in the remote path or specified with as remotecmd.\n"
"- path is relative to the remote user's home directory by default. Use\n"
"  an extra slash at the start of a path to specify an absolute path::\n"
"\n"
"    ssh://example.com//tmp/repository\n"
"\n"
"- Mercurial doesn't use its own compression via SSH; the right thing\n"
"  to do is to configure it in your ~/.ssh/config, e.g.::\n"
"\n"
"    Host *.mylocalnetwork.example.com\n"
"      Compression no\n"
"    Host *\n"
"      Compression yes\n"
"\n"
"  Alternatively specify \"ssh -C\" as your ssh command in your hgrc or\n"
"  with the --ssh command line option.\n"
"\n"
"These URLs can all be stored in your hgrc with path aliases under the\n"
"[paths] section like so::\n"
"\n"
"  [paths]\n"
"  alias1 = URL1\n"
"  alias2 = URL2\n"
"  ...\n"
"\n"
"You can then use the alias for any command that uses a URL (for\n"
"example 'hg pull alias1' will be treated as 'hg pull URL1').\n"
"\n"
"Two path aliases are special because they are used as defaults when\n"
"you do not provide the URL to a command:\n"
"\n"
"default:\n"
"  When you create a repository with hg clone, the clone command saves\n"
"  the location of the source repository as the new repository's\n"
"  'default' path. This is then used when you omit path from push- and\n"
"  pull-like commands (including incoming and outgoing).\n"
"\n"
"default-push:\n"
"  The push command will look for a path named 'default-push', and\n"
