msgid ""
"The working directory of a Mercurial repository will often contain\n"

"files created by editors and build products created by compilers.\n"
"These files can be ignored by listing them in a ``.hgignore`` file in\n"
"the root of the working directory. The ``.hgignore`` file must be\n"
"created manually. It is typically put under version control, so that\n"
"the settings will propagate to other repositories with push and pull."

msgid ""
"An untracked file is ignored if its path relative to the repository\n"
"root directory, or any prefix path of that path, is matched against\n"
"any pattern in ``.hgignore``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, say we have an untracked file, ``file.c``, at\n"
"``a/b/file.c`` inside our repository. Mercurial will ignore ``file.c``\n"

msgid ""
"In addition, a Mercurial configuration file can reference a set of\n"

"configure these files."

"commands support the ``-I`` and ``-X`` options; see\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An ignore file is a plain text file consisting of a list of patterns,\n"
