"hooks for controlling repository access\n"
"\n"
"This hook makes it possible to allow or deny write access to portions\n"
"of a repository when receiving incoming changesets.\n"
"\n"
"The authorization is matched based on the local user name on the\n"
"system where the hook runs, and not the committer of the original\n"
"changeset (since the latter is merely informative).\n"
"\n"
"The acl hook is best used along with a restricted shell like hgsh,\n"
"preventing authenticating users from doing anything other than\n"
"pushing or pulling. The hook is not safe to use if users have\n"
"interactive shell access, as they can then disable the hook.\n"
"Nor is it safe if remote users share an account, because then there\n"
"is no way to distinguish them.\n"
"\n"
"To use this hook, configure the acl extension in your hgrc like this::\n"
"\n"
"  [extensions]\n"
"  hgext.acl =\n"
"\n"
"  [hooks]\n"
"  pretxnchangegroup.acl = python:hgext.acl.hook\n"
"\n"
"  [acl]\n"
"  # Check whether the source of incoming changes is in this list\n"
"  # (\"serve\" == ssh or http, \"push\", \"pull\", \"bundle\")\n"
"  sources = serve\n"
"\n"
"The allow and deny sections take a subtree pattern as key (with a glob\n"
"syntax by default), and a comma separated list of users as the\n"
"corresponding value. The deny list is checked before the allow list\n"
"is. ::\n"
"\n"
"  [acl.allow]\n"
"  # If acl.allow is not present, all users are allowed by default.\n"
"  # An empty acl.allow section means no users allowed.\n"
"  docs/** = doc_writer\n"
"  .hgtags = release_engineer\n"
"\n"
"  [acl.deny]\n"

"hooks for integrating with the Bugzilla bug tracker\n"
"\n"
"This hook extension adds comments on bugs in Bugzilla when changesets\n"
"that refer to bugs by Bugzilla ID are seen. The hook does not change\n"
"bug status.\n"
"\n"
"The hook updates the Bugzilla database directly. Only Bugzilla\n"
"installations using MySQL are supported.\n"
"\n"
"The hook relies on a Bugzilla script to send bug change notification\n"
"emails. That script changes between Bugzilla versions; the\n"
"'processmail' script used prior to 2.18 is replaced in 2.18 and\n"
"subsequent versions by 'config/sendbugmail.pl'. Note that these will\n"
"be run by Mercurial as the user pushing the change; you will need to\n"
"ensure the Bugzilla install file permissions are set appropriately.\n"
"\n"
"The extension is configured through three different configuration\n"
"sections. These keys are recognized in the [bugzilla] section:\n"
"\n"
"host\n"
"  Hostname of the MySQL server holding the Bugzilla database.\n"
"\n"
"db\n"
"  Name of the Bugzilla database in MySQL. Default 'bugs'.\n"
"\n"
"user\n"
"  Username to use to access MySQL server. Default 'bugs'.\n"
"\n"
"password\n"
"  Password to use to access MySQL server.\n"
"\n"
"timeout\n"
"  Database connection timeout (seconds). Default 5.\n"
"\n"
"version\n"
"  Bugzilla version. Specify '3.0' for Bugzilla versions 3.0 and later,\n"
"  '2.18' for Bugzilla versions from 2.18 and '2.16' for versions prior\n"
"  to 2.18.\n"
"\n"
"bzuser\n"
"  Fallback Bugzilla user name to record comments with, if changeset\n"
"  committer cannot be found as a Bugzilla user.\n"
"\n"
"bzdir\n"
"   Bugzilla install directory. Used by default notify. Default\n"
"   '/var/www/html/bugzilla'.\n"
"\n"
"notify\n"
"  The command to run to get Bugzilla to send bug change notification\n"
"  emails. Substitutes from a map with 3 keys, 'bzdir', 'id' (bug id)\n"
"  and 'user' (committer bugzilla email). Default depends on version;\n"
"  from 2.18 it is \"cd %(bzdir)s && perl -T contrib/sendbugmail.pl\n"
"  %(id)s %(user)s\".\n"
"\n"
"regexp\n"
"  Regular expression to match bug IDs in changeset commit message.\n"
"  Must contain one \"()\" group. The default expression matches 'Bug\n"
"  1234', 'Bug no. 1234', 'Bug number 1234', 'Bugs 1234,5678', 'Bug\n"
"  1234 and 5678' and variations thereof. Matching is case insensitive.\n"
"\n"
"style\n"
"  The style file to use when formatting comments.\n"
"\n"
"template\n"
"  Template to use when formatting comments. Overrides style if\n"
"  specified. In addition to the usual Mercurial keywords, the\n"
"  extension specifies::\n"
"\n"
"    {bug}       The Bugzilla bug ID.\n"
"    {root}      The full pathname of the Mercurial repository.\n"
"    {webroot}   Stripped pathname of the Mercurial repository.\n"
"    {hgweb}     Base URL for browsing Mercurial repositories.\n"
"\n"
"  Default 'changeset {node|short} in repo {root} refers '\n"
"          'to bug {bug}.\\ndetails:\\n\\t{desc|tabindent}'\n"
"\n"
"strip\n"
"  The number of slashes to strip from the front of {root} to produce\n"
"  {webroot}. Default 0.\n"
"\n"
"usermap\n"
"  Path of file containing Mercurial committer ID to Bugzilla user ID\n"
"  mappings. If specified, the file should contain one mapping per\n"
"  line, \"committer\"=\"Bugzilla user\". See also the [usermap] section.\n"

"The [usermap] section is used to specify mappings of Mercurial\n"
"committer ID to Bugzilla user ID. See also [bugzilla].usermap.\n"

"    commands to find files to convert. This means that unless a\n"

"\n"
"      --config convert.cvsps='cvsps -A -u --cvs-direct -q'\n"
"\n"

"\n"

"\n"
"    --config convert.cvsps.cache=True         (boolean)\n"
"        Set to False to disable remote log caching, for testing and\n"
"        debugging purposes.\n"
"    --config convert.cvsps.fuzz=60            (integer)\n"
"        Specify the maximum time (in seconds) that is allowed between\n"
"        commits with identical user and log message in a single\n"
"        changeset. When very large files were checked in as part of a\n"
"        changeset then the default may not be long enough.\n"
"    --config convert.cvsps.mergeto='{{mergetobranch ([-\\w]+)}}'\n"
"        Specify a regular expression to which commit log messages are\n"
"        matched. If a match occurs, then the conversion process will\n"
"        insert a dummy revision merging the branch on which this log\n"

"    Subversion Source\n"
"    -----------------\n"
"\n"
"    Subversion source detects classical trunk/branches/tags layouts.\n"
"    By default, the supplied \"svn://repo/path/\" source URL is\n"
"    converted as a single branch. If \"svn://repo/path/trunk\" exists it\n"
"    replaces the default branch. If \"svn://repo/path/branches\" exists,\n"
"    its subdirectories are listed as possible branches. If\n"
"    \"svn://repo/path/tags\" exists, it is looked for tags referencing\n"
"    converted branches. Default \"trunk\", \"branches\" and \"tags\" values\n"
"    can be overridden with following options. Set them to paths\n"
"    relative to the source URL, or leave them blank to disable auto\n"
"    detection.\n"
"\n"
"    --config convert.svn.branches=branches    (directory name)\n"
"        specify the directory containing branches\n"
"    --config convert.svn.tags=tags            (directory name)\n"
"        specify the directory containing tags\n"
"    --config convert.svn.trunk=trunk          (directory name)\n"
"        specify the name of the trunk branch\n"
"\n"
"    Source history can be retrieved starting at a specific revision,\n"
"    instead of being integrally converted. Only single branch\n"
"    conversions are supported.\n"
"\n"
"    --config convert.svn.startrev=0           (svn revision number)\n"
"        specify start Subversion revision.\n"
"\n"
"    Perforce Source\n"
"    ---------------\n"
"\n"
"    The Perforce (P4) importer can be given a p4 depot path or a\n"
"    client specification as source. It will convert all files in the\n"
"    source to a flat Mercurial repository, ignoring labels, branches\n"
"    and integrations. Note that when a depot path is given you then\n"
"    usually should specify a target directory, because otherwise the\n"
"    target may be named ...-hg.\n"
"\n"
"    It is possible to limit the amount of source history to be\n"
"    converted by specifying an initial Perforce revision.\n"

"    Mercurial has the ability to add new features through the use of\n"
"    extensions. Extensions may add new commands, add options to\n"
"    existing commands, change the default behavior of commands, or\n"
"    implement hooks.\n"
"\n"
"    Extensions are not loaded by default for a variety of reasons:\n"
"    they can increase startup overhead; they may be meant for advanced\n"
"    usage only; they may provide potentially dangerous abilities (such\n"
"    as letting you destroy or modify history); they might not be ready\n"
"    for prime time; or they may alter some usual behaviors of stock\n"
"    Mercurial. It is thus up to the user to activate extensions as\n"
"    needed.\n"
"\n"
"    To enable the \"foo\" extension, either shipped with Mercurial or in\n"
"    the Python search path, create an entry for it in your hgrc, like\n"
"    this::\n"
"\n"
"      [extensions]\n"

"      \"Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006\" (local timezone assumed)\n"

"\n"
"      \"1165432709 0\" (Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006 UTC)\n"

"    offset is the offset of the local timezone, in seconds west of UTC\n"
"    (negative if the timezone is east of UTC).\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"      \"<{datetime}\" - at or before a given date/time\n"
"      \">{datetime}\" - on or after a given date/time\n"

"\n"
"    Mercurial accepts several notations for identifying one or more\n"

"\n"
"    By default, Mercurial treats filenames as shell-style extended\n"
"    glob patterns.\n"
"\n"
"    Alternate pattern notations must be specified explicitly.\n"
"\n"
"    To use a plain path name without any pattern matching, start it\n"
"    with \"path:\". These path names must completely match starting at\n"
"    the current repository root.\n"
"\n"
"    To use an extended glob, start a name with \"glob:\". Globs are\n"
"    rooted at the current directory; a glob such as \"``*.c``\" will\n"
"    only match files in the current directory ending with \".c\".\n"
"\n"
"    The supported glob syntax extensions are \"``**``\" to match any\n"
"    string across path separators and \"{a,b}\" to mean \"a or b\".\n"
"\n"
"    To use a Perl/Python regular expression, start a name with \"re:\".\n"
"    Regexp pattern matching is anchored at the root of the repository.\n"
"\n"
"    Plain examples::\n"
"\n"
"      path:foo/bar   a name bar in a directory named foo in the root\n"
"                     of the repository\n"
"      path:path:name a file or directory named \"path:name\"\n"
"\n"
"    Glob examples::\n"
"\n"
"      glob:*.c       any name ending in \".c\" in the current directory\n"
"      *.c            any name ending in \".c\" in the current directory\n"
"      **.c           any name ending in \".c\" in any subdirectory of the\n"
"                     current directory including itself.\n"

"\n"
"    Mercurial supports several ways to specify individual revisions.\n"
"\n"
"    A plain integer is treated as a revision number. Negative integers\n"
"    are treated as sequential offsets from the tip, with -1 denoting\n"
"    the tip, -2 denoting the revision prior to the tip, and so forth.\n"
"\n"
"    A 40-digit hexadecimal string is treated as a unique revision\n"
"    identifier.\n"
"\n"
"    A hexadecimal string less than 40 characters long is treated as a\n"
"    unique revision identifier and is referred to as a short-form\n"
"    identifier. A short-form identifier is only valid if it is the\n"
"    prefix of exactly one full-length identifier.\n"
"\n"
"    Any other string is treated as a tag or branch name. A tag name is\n"
"    a symbolic name associated with a revision identifier. A branch\n"
"    name denotes the tipmost revision of that branch. Tag and branch\n"
"    names must not contain the \":\" character.\n"
"\n"
"    The reserved name \"tip\" is a special tag that always identifies\n"
"    the most recent revision.\n"
"\n"
"    The reserved name \"null\" indicates the null revision. This is the\n"
"    revision of an empty repository, and the parent of revision 0.\n"
"\n"
"    The reserved name \".\" indicates the working directory parent. If\n"
"    no working directory is checked out, it is equivalent to null. If\n"
"    an uncommitted merge is in progress, \".\" is the revision of the\n"
"    first parent.\n"
"    "
msgstr ""

msgid "Specifying Multiple Revisions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\n"
"    When Mercurial accepts more than one revision, they may be\n"
"    specified individually, or provided as a topologically continuous\n"
"    range, separated by the \":\" character.\n"
"\n"
"    The syntax of range notation is [BEGIN]:[END], where BEGIN and END\n"
"    are revision identifiers. Both BEGIN and END are optional. If\n"
"    BEGIN is not specified, it defaults to revision number 0. If END\n"
"    is not specified, it defaults to the tip. The range \":\" thus means\n"
"    \"all revisions\".\n"
"\n"
"    If BEGIN is greater than END, revisions are treated in reverse\n"
"    order.\n"

msgid "Diff Formats"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\n"
"    Mercurial's default format for showing changes between two\n"
"    versions of a file is compatible with the unified format of GNU\n"
"    diff, which can be used by GNU patch and many other standard\n"
"    tools.\n"
"\n"
"    While this standard format is often enough, it does not encode the\n"
"    following information:\n"
"\n"
"    - executable status and other permission bits\n"
"    - copy or rename information\n"
"    - changes in binary files\n"
"    - creation or deletion of empty files\n"
"\n"
"    Mercurial also supports the extended diff format from the git VCS\n"
"    which addresses these limitations. The git diff format is not\n"
"    produced by default because a few widespread tools still do not\n"
"    understand this format.\n"
"\n"
"    This means that when generating diffs from a Mercurial repository\n"
"    (e.g. with \"hg export\"), you should be careful about things like\n"
"    file copies and renames or other things mentioned above, because\n"
"    when applying a standard diff to a different repository, this\n"
"    extra information is lost. Mercurial's internal operations (like\n"
"    push and pull) are not affected by this, because they use an\n"
"    internal binary format for communicating changes.\n"
"\n"
"    To make Mercurial produce the git extended diff format, use the\n"
"    --git option available for many commands, or set 'git = True' in\n"
"    the [diff] section of your hgrc. You do not need to set this\n"
"    option when importing diffs in this format or using them in the mq\n"
"    extension.\n"

msgid "Template Usage"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\n"
"    Mercurial allows you to customize output of commands through\n"
"    templates. You can either pass in a template from the command\n"
"    line, via the --template option, or select an existing\n"
"    template-style (--style).\n"
"\n"
"    You can customize output for any \"log-like\" command: log,\n"
"    outgoing, incoming, tip, parents, heads and glog.\n"
"\n"
"    Three styles are packaged with Mercurial: default (the style used\n"
"    when no explicit preference is passed), compact and changelog.\n"
"    Usage::\n"
"\n"
"        $ hg log -r1 --style changelog\n"
"\n"
"    A template is a piece of text, with markup to invoke variable\n"
"    expansion::\n"
"\n"
"        $ hg log -r1 --template \"{node}\\n\"\n"
"        b56ce7b07c52de7d5fd79fb89701ea538af65746\n"
"\n"
"    Strings in curly braces are called keywords. The availability of\n"
"    keywords depends on the exact context of the templater. These\n"
"    keywords are usually available for templating a log-like command:\n"
"\n"
"    :author:    String. The unmodified author of the changeset.\n"
"    :branches:  String. The name of the branch on which the changeset\n"
"                was committed. Will be empty if the branch name was\n"
"                default.\n"
"    :date:      Date information. The date when the changeset was\n"
"                committed.\n"
"    :desc:      String. The text of the changeset description.\n"

"    :rev:       Integer. The repository-local changeset revision\n"
"                number.\n"
"    :tags:      List of strings. Any tags associated with the\n"
"                changeset.\n"
"\n"
"    The \"date\" keyword does not produce human-readable output. If you\n"
"    want to use a date in your output, you can use a filter to process\n"
"    it. Filters are functions which return a string based on the input\n"
"    variable. You can also use a chain of filters to get the desired\n"
"    output::\n"
"\n"

"    only possible if the feature is explicitly enabled on the remote\n"
"    Mercurial server.\n"
"\n"
"    Some notes about using SSH with Mercurial:\n"
"\n"
"    - SSH requires an accessible shell account on the destination\n"
"      machine and a copy of hg in the remote path or specified with as\n"
"      remotecmd.\n"
"    - path is relative to the remote user's home directory by default.\n"
"      Use an extra slash at the start of a path to specify an absolute\n"
"      path::\n"
"\n"
"        ssh://example.com//tmp/repository\n"
"\n"
"    - Mercurial doesn't use its own compression via SSH; the right\n"
"      thing to do is to configure it in your ~/.ssh/config, e.g.::\n"
"\n"
"        Host *.mylocalnetwork.example.com\n"
"          Compression no\n"
"        Host *\n"
"          Compression yes\n"
"\n"
"      Alternatively specify \"ssh -C\" as your ssh command in your hgrc\n"
"      or with the --ssh command line option.\n"
"\n"
"    These URLs can all be stored in your hgrc with path aliases under\n"
"    the [paths] section like so::\n"
"\n"
"      [paths]\n"
"      alias1 = URL1\n"
"      alias2 = URL2\n"
"      ...\n"
"\n"
"    You can then use the alias for any command that uses a URL (for\n"
"    example 'hg pull alias1' would pull from the 'alias1' path).\n"
"\n"
"    Two path aliases are special because they are used as defaults\n"
"    when you do not provide the URL to a command:\n"
"\n"
"    default:\n"
"      When you create a repository with hg clone, the clone command\n"
"      saves the location of the source repository as the new\n"
"      repository's 'default' path. This is then used when you omit\n"
"      path from push- and pull-like commands (including incoming and\n"
"      outgoing).\n"
"\n"
"    default-push:\n"
"      The push command will look for a path named 'default-push', and\n"
"      prefer it over 'default' if both are defined.\n"
