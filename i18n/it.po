"Mercurial's default format for showing changes between two versions of\n"
"a file is compatible with the unified format of GNU diff, which can be\n"
"used by GNU patch and many other standard tools."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While this standard format is often enough, it does not encode the\n"

"Mercurial also supports the extended diff format from the git VCS\n"
"which addresses these limitations. The git diff format is not produced\n"
"by default because a few widespread tools still do not understand this\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This means that when generating diffs from a Mercurial repository\n"
"(e.g. with \"hg export\"), you should be careful about things like file\n"
"copies and renames or other things mentioned above, because when\n"
"applying a standard diff to a different repository, this extra\n"
"information is lost. Mercurial's internal operations (like push and\n"
"pull) are not affected by this, because they use an internal binary\n"
"format for communicating changes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make Mercurial produce the git extended diff format, use the --git\n"

msgid ""
"HGENCODINGMODE\n"
"    This sets Mercurial's behavior for handling unknown characters\n"

msgid ""
"EDITOR\n"
"    Sometimes Mercurial needs to open a text file in an editor for a\n"

"Mercurial has the ability to add new features through the use of\n"
"extensions. Extensions may add new commands, add options to\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Extensions are not loaded by default for a variety of reasons:\n"
"they can increase startup overhead; they may be meant for advanced\n"

"When Mercurial accepts more than one revision, they may be specified\n"

"separated by the \":\" character."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The syntax of range notation is [BEGIN]:[END], where BEGIN and END are\n"
"revision identifiers. Both BEGIN and END are optional. If BEGIN is not\n"

"it defaults to the tip. The range \":\" thus means \"all revisions\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "If BEGIN is greater than END, revisions are treated in reverse order."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A range acts as a closed interval. This means that a range of 3:5\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mercurial accepts several notations for identifying one or more files\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
