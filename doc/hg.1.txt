NAME
----
hg - Mercurial source code management system

SYNOPSIS
--------
'hg' [-v -d -q -y] <command> [command options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The hg(1) command provides a command line interface to the Mercurial system.

OPTIONS
-------

--debug, -d::
    enable debugging output

--quiet, -q::
    suppress output

--verbose, -v::
    enable additional output

--noninteractive, -y::
    do not prompt, assume 'yes' for any required answers

COMMAND ELEMENTS
----------------

files ...::
    indicates one or more filename or relative path filenames

path::
    indicates a path on the local machine

revision::
    indicates a changeset which can be specified as a changeset revision
    number, a tag, or a unique substring of the changeset hash value

repository path::
    either the pathname of a local repository or the URI of a remote
    repository.  There are two available URI protocols, http:// which is
    fast and the old-http:// protocol which is much slower but does not
    require a special server on the web host.

COMMANDS
--------

add [files ...]::
    Schedule files to be version controlled and added to the repository.
    
    The files will be added to the repository at the next commit.

addremove::
    Add all new files and remove all missing files from the repository.
    
    New files are ignored if they match any of the patterns in .hgignore. As
    with add, these changes take effect at the next commit.

annotate [-r <rev> -u -n -c] [files ...]::
    List changes in files, showing the revision id responsible for each line
    
    This command is useful to discover who did a change or when a change took
    place.
    
    options:
    -r, --revision <rev>  annotate the specified revision
    -u, --user            list the author
    -c, --changeset       list the changeset
    -n, --number          list the revision number (default)

cat <file> [revision]::
    Output to stdout the given revision for the specified file.

    If no revision is given then the tip is used.

clone [-U] <source> [dest]::
    Create a copy of an existing repository in a new directory.

    If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the
    basename of the source.

    The source is added to the new repository's .hg/hgrc file to be used in
    future pulls.

    For efficiency, hardlinks are used for cloning whenever the
    source and destination are on the same filesystem.

    options:
    -U, --noupdate   do not update the new working directory

commit [-A -t -l <file> -t <text> -u <user> -d <datecode>] [files...]::
    Commit changes to the given files into the repository.
    
    If a list of files is omitted, all changes reported by "hg status"
    will be commited.
    
    The HGEDITOR or EDITOR environment variables are used to start an
    editor to add a commit comment.

    Options:

    -A, --addremove       run addremove during commit
    -t, --text <text>     use <text> as commit message
    -l, --logfile <file>  show the commit message for the given file
    -d, --date <datecode> record datecode as commit date
    -u, --user <user>     record user as commiter

    aliases: ci

copy <source> <dest>::
    Mark <dest> file as a copy or rename of a <source> one
    
    This command takes effect for the next commit.

diff [-r revision] [-r revision] [files ...]::
    Show differences between revisions for the specified files.
    
    Differences between files are shown using the unified diff format.
    
    When two revision arguments are given, then changes are shown
    between those revisions. If only one revision is specified then
    that revision is compared to the working directory, and, when no
    revisions are specified, the working directory files are compared
    to its parent.

export [-o filespec] [revision] ...::
    Print the changeset header and diffs for one or more revisions.

    The information shown in the changeset header is: author,
    changeset hash, parent and commit comment.

    Output may be to a file, in which case the name of the file is
    given using a format string.  The formatting rules are as follows:

    %%   literal "%" character
    %H   changeset hash (40 bytes of hexadecimal)
    %N   number of patches being generated
    %R   changeset revision number
    %b   basename of the exporting repository
    %h   short-form changeset hash (12 bytes of hexadecimal)
    %n   zero-padded sequence number, starting at 1
    %r   zero-padded changeset revision number

    Options:

    -o, --output <filespec>   print output to file with formatted named

forget [files]::
    Undo an 'hg add' scheduled for the next commit.

heads::
    Show all repository head changesets.
    
    Repository "heads" are changesets that don't have children
    changesets. They are where development generally takes place and
    are the usual targets for update and merge operations.

identify::
    Print a short summary of the current state of the repo.
    
    This summary identifies the repository state using one or two parent
    hash identifiers, followed by a "+" if there are uncommitted changes
    in the working directory, followed by a list of tags for this revision.

    aliases: id

import [-p <n> -b <base> -q] <patches>::
    Import a list of patches and commit them individually.

    options:
    -p, --strip <n>   directory strip option for patch. This has the same
                      meaning as the correnponding patch option
    -b <path>         base directory to read patches from

    aliases: patch

init::
    Initialize a new repository in the current directory.

log [-r revision ...] [file]::
    Print the revision history of the specified file or the entire project.

    By default this command outputs: changeset id and hash, tags,
    parents, user, date and time, and a summary for each commit. The
    -v switch adds some more detail, such as changed files, manifest
    hashes or message signatures.

    When a revision argument is given, only this file or changelog revision
    is displayed. With two revision arguments all revisions in this range
    are listed. Additional revision arguments may be given repeating the above
    cycle.

    aliases: history

manifest [revision]::
    Print a list of version controlled files for the given revision.

    The manifest is the list of files being version controlled. If no revision
    is given then the tip is used.

parents::
    Print the working directory's parent revisions.

pull <repository path>::
    Pull changes from a remote repository to a local one.

    This finds all changes from the repository at the specified path
    or URL and adds them to the local repository. By default, this
    does not update the copy of the project in the working directory.

    options:
    -u, --update   update the working directory to tip after pull

push <destination>::
    Push changes from the local repository to the given destination.
    
    This is the symmetrical operation for pull. It helps to move
    changes from the current repository to a different one. If the
    destination is local this is identical to a pull in that directory
    from the current one.

    The other currently available push method is SSH. This requires an
    accessible shell account on the destination machine and a copy of
    hg in the remote path. Destinations are specified in the following
    form:

      ssh://[user@]host[:port]/path

rawcommit [-p -d -u -F -t -l]::
    Lowlevel commit, for use in helper scripts.
    
    This command is not intended to be used by normal users, as it is
    primarily useful for importing from other SCMs.

recover::
    Recover from an interrupted commit or pull.
    
    This command tries to fix the repository status after an interrupted
    operation. It should only be necessary when Mercurial suggests it.

remove [files ...]::
    Schedule the indicated files for removal from the repository.
    
    This command shedules the files to be removed at the next commit.
    This only removes files from the current branch, not from the
    entire project history.

    aliases: rm

revert [names ...]::
    Revert any uncommitted modifications made to the named files or
    directories.  This restores the contents of the affected files to
    an unmodified state.

    If a file has been deleted, it is recreated.  If the executable
    mode of a file was changed, it is reset.

    If a directory is given, all files in that directory and its
    subdirectories are reverted.

    If no arguments are given, all files in the current directory and
    its subdirectories are reverted.

    options:
    -r, --rev <rev>       revision to revert to
    -n, --nonrecursive    do not recurse into subdirectories

root::
    Print the root directory of the current repository.

serve [-a addr -l logfile -n name -p port -t templatedir]::
    Start a local HTTP repository browser and pull server.

    By default, the server logs accesses to stdout and errors to
    stderr.  Use the "-A" and "-E" options to log to files.

    options:
    -A, --accesslog <file>   name of access log file to write to
    -E, --errorlog <file>    name of error log file to write to
    -a, --address <addr>     address to use
    -p, --port <n>           port to use (default: 8000)
    -n, --name <name>        name to show in web pages (default: working dir)
    -t, --templatedir <path> web templates to use

status::
    Show changed files in the working directory.

    The codes used to show the status of files are:
    
    C = changed
    A = added
    R = removed
    ? = not tracked

tag [-t <text> -d <datecode> -u <user>] <name> [revision]::
    Name a particular revision using <name>.
    
    Tags are used to name particular revisions of the repository and are
    very useful to compare different revision, to go back to significant
    earlier versions or to mark branch points as releases, etc.
    
    If no revision is given, the tip is used.

    To facilitate version control, distribution, and merging of tags,
    they are stored as a file named ".hgtags" which is managed
    similarly to other project files and can be hand-edited if
    necessary.

    options:
    -t, --text <text>     message for tag commit log entry
    -d, --date <datecode> datecode for commit
    -u, --user <user>     user for commit

    Note: Mercurial also has support for "local tags" that are not
    version-controlled or distributed which are stored in the .hg/hgrc
    file.

tags::
    List the repository tags.

    This lists both regular and local tags.

tip::
    Show the tip revision.

undo::
    Undo the last commit or pull transaction.

    Roll back the last pull or commit transaction on the
    repository, restoring the project to its earlier state.

    This command should be used with care. There is only one level of
    undo and there is no redo.

    This command is not intended for use on public repositories. Once
    a change is visible for pull by other users, undoing it locally is
    ineffective.

update [-m -C] [revision]::
    Update the working directory to the specified revision.

    By default, update will refuse to run if doing so would require
    merging or discarding local changes.

    With the -m option, a merge will be performed.

    With the -C option, local changes will be lost.
    
    options:
    -m, --merge       allow merging of branches
    -C, --clean       overwrite locally modified files

    aliases: up checkout co

verify::
    Verify the integrity of the current repository.

    This will perform an extensive check of the repository's
    integrity, validating the hashes and checksums of each entry in
    the changelog, manifest, and tracked files, as well as the
    integrity of their crosslinks and indices.

SPECIFYING SINGLE REVISIONS
---------------------------

    Mercurial accepts several notations for identifying individual
    revisions.

    A plain integer is treated as a revision number.  Negative
    integers are treated as offsets from the tip, with -1 denoting the
    tip.

    A 40-digit hexadecimal string is treated as a unique revision
    identifier.

    A hexadecimal string less than 40 characters long is treated as a
    unique revision identifier, and referred to as a short-form
    identifier.  A short-form identifier is only valid if it is the
    prefix of one full-length identifier.

    Any other string is treated as a tag name, which is a symbolic
    name associated with a revision identifier.  Tag names may not
    contain the ":" character.

    The reserved name "tip" is a special tag that always identifies
    the most recent revision.

SPECIFYING MULTIPLE REVISIONS
-----------------------------

    When Mercurial accepts more than one revision, they may be
    specified individually, or provided as a continuous range,
    separated by the ":" character.

    The syntax of range notation is [BEGIN]:[END], where BEGIN and END
    are revision identifiers.  Both BEGIN and END are optional.  If
    BEGIN is not specified, it defaults to revision number 0.  If END
    is not specified, it defaults to the tip.  The range ":" thus
    means "all revisions".

    If BEGIN is greater than END, revisions are treated in reverse
    order.

    A range acts as an open interval.  This means that a range of 3:5
    gives 3, 4 and 5.  Similarly, a range of 4:2 gives 4, 3, and 2.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------

HGEDITOR::
    This is the name of the editor to use when committing. Defaults to the
    value of EDITOR.

HGMERGE::
    An executable to use for resolving merge conflicts. The program
    will be executed with three arguments: local file, remote file,
    ancestor file.

    The default program is "hgmerge", which is a shell script provided
    by Mercurial with some sensible defaults.

HGUSER::
    This is the string used for the author of a commit.

EMAIL::
    If HGUSER is not set, this will be used as the author for a commit.

LOGNAME::
    If neither HGUSER nor EMAIL is set, LOGNAME will be used (with
    '@hostname' appended) as the author value for a commit.

EDITOR::
    This is the name of the editor used in the hgmerge script. It will be
    used for commit messages if HGEDITOR isn't set. Defaults to 'vi'.

PYTHONPATH::
    This is used by Python to find imported modules and may need to be set
    appropriately if Mercurial is not installed system-wide.

FILES
-----
 .hgignore::
    This file contains regular expressions (one per line) that describe file
    names that should be ignored by hg.

 .hgtags::
    This file contains changeset hash values and text tag names (one of each
    seperated by spaces) that correspond to tagged versions of the repository
    contents.

 $HOME/.hgrc, .hg/hgrc::
    This file contains defaults and configuration. Values in .hg/hgrc
    override those in .hgrc.

NAMED REPOSITORIES
------------------

To give symbolic names to a repository, create a section in .hgrc
or .hg/hgrc containing assignments of names to paths. Example:

-----------------
[paths]
hg = http://selenic.com/hg
tah = http://hg.intevation.org/mercurial-tah/
-----------------


LOCAL TAGS
----------

To create tags that are local to the repository and not distributed or
version-controlled, create an hgrc section like the following:

----------------
[tags]
working = 2dcced388cab3677a8f543c3c47a0ad34ac9d435
tested = 12e0fdbc57a0be78f0e817fd1d170a3615cd35da
----------------


HOOKS
-----

Mercurial supports a set of 'hook', commands that get automatically
executed by various actions such as starting or finishing a commit. To
specify a hook, simply create an hgrc section like the following:

-----------------
[hooks]
precommit = echo "this hook gets executed immediately before a commit"
commit = hg export $NODE | mail -s "new commit $NODE" commit-list
-----------------


NON_TRANSPARENT PROXY SUPPORT
-----------------------------

To access a Mercurial repository through a proxy, create a file
$HOME/.hgrc in the following format:

--------------
[http_proxy]
host=myproxy:8080
user=<username>
passwd=<password>
no=<localhost1>,<localhost2>,<localhost3>,...
--------------

"user" and "passwd" fields are used for authenticating proxies, "no" is a
comma-separated list of local host names to not proxy.
