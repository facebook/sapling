NAME
----
hg - Mercurial source code management system

SYNOPSIS
--------
'hg' [-v -d -q -y] <command> [command options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The hg(1) command provides a command line interface to the Mercurial system.

OPTIONS
-------

-R, --repository::
    repository root directory
    
--cwd::
    change working directory

-y, --noninteractive::
    do not prompt, assume 'yes' for any required answers

-q, --quiet::
    suppress output

-v, --verbose::
    enable additional output

--debug::
    enable debugging output

--traceback::
    print traceback on exception

--time::
    time how long the command takes

--profile::
    print command execution profile

--version::
    output version information and exit

-h, --help::
    display help and exit

COMMAND ELEMENTS
----------------

files ...::
    indicates one or more filename or relative path filenames; see
    "FILE NAME PATTERNS" for information on pattern matching

path::
    indicates a path on the local machine

revision::
    indicates a changeset which can be specified as a changeset revision
    number, a tag, or a unique substring of the changeset hash value

repository path::
    either the pathname of a local repository or the URI of a remote
    repository.  There are two available URI protocols, http:// which is
    fast and the old-http:// protocol which is much slower but does not
    require a special server on the web host.

COMMANDS
--------

add [options] [files ...]::
    Schedule files to be version controlled and added to the repository.
    
    The files will be added to the repository at the next commit.

    If no names are given, add all files in the current directory and
    its subdirectories.

addremove [options] [files ...]::
    Add all new files and remove all missing files from the repository.
    
    New files are ignored if they match any of the patterns in .hgignore. As
    with add, these changes take effect at the next commit.

annotate [-r <rev> -u -n -c] [files ...]::
    List changes in files, showing the revision id responsible for each line
    
    This command is useful to discover who did a change or when a change took
    place.

    Without the -a option, annotate will avoid processing files it
    detects as binary. With -a, annotate will generate an annotation
    anyway, probably with undesirable results.
    
    options:
    -a, --text            treat all files as text
    -I, --include <pat>   include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude <pat>   exclude names matching the given patterns
    -r, --revision <rev>  annotate the specified revision
    -u, --user            list the author
    -c, --changeset       list the changeset
    -n, --number          list the revision number (default)

cat <file> [revision]::
    Output to stdout the given revision for the specified file.

    If no revision is given then the tip is used.

clone [-U] <source> [dest]::
    Create a copy of an existing repository in a new directory.

    If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the
    basename of the source.

    The source is added to the new repository's .hg/hgrc file to be used in
    future pulls.

    For efficiency, hardlinks are used for cloning whenever the
    source and destination are on the same filesystem.

    options:
    -U, --noupdate   do not update the new working directory
    -e, --ssh        specify ssh command to use
    --remotecmd      specify hg command to run on the remote side

commit [options] [files...]::
    Commit changes to the given files into the repository.
    
    If a list of files is omitted, all changes reported by "hg status"
    from the root of the repository will be commited.
    
    The HGEDITOR or EDITOR environment variables are used to start an
    editor to add a commit comment.

    Options:

    -A, --addremove       run addremove during commit
    -I, --include <pat>   include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude <pat>   exclude names matching the given patterns
    -m, --message <text>  use <text> as commit message
    -l, --logfile <file>  read the commit message from <file>
    -d, --date <datecode> record datecode as commit date
    -u, --user <user>     record user as commiter

    aliases: ci

copy <source> <dest>::
    Mark <dest> file as a copy or rename of a <source> one
    
    This command takes effect for the next commit.

diff [-a] [-r revision] [-r revision] [files ...]::
    Show differences between revisions for the specified files.
    
    Differences between files are shown using the unified diff format.
    
    When two revision arguments are given, then changes are shown
    between those revisions. If only one revision is specified then
    that revision is compared to the working directory, and, when no
    revisions are specified, the working directory files are compared
    to its parent.

    Without the -a option, diff will avoid generating diffs of files
    it detects as binary. With -a, diff will generate a diff anyway,
    probably with undesirable results.

    options:
    -a, --text           treat all files as text
    -I, --include <pat>  include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude <pat>  exclude names matching the given patterns

export [-o filespec] [revision] ...::
    Print the changeset header and diffs for one or more revisions.

    The information shown in the changeset header is: author,
    changeset hash, parent and commit comment.

    Output may be to a file, in which case the name of the file is
    given using a format string.  The formatting rules are as follows:

    %%   literal "%" character
    %H   changeset hash (40 bytes of hexadecimal)
    %N   number of patches being generated
    %R   changeset revision number
    %b   basename of the exporting repository
    %h   short-form changeset hash (12 bytes of hexadecimal)
    %n   zero-padded sequence number, starting at 1
    %r   zero-padded changeset revision number

    Without the -a option, export will avoid generating diffs of files
    it detects as binary. With -a, export will generate a diff anyway,
    probably with undesirable results.

    options:
    -a, --text                treat all files as text
    -o, --output <filespec>   print output to file with formatted named

forget [options] [files]::
    Undo an 'hg add' scheduled for the next commit.

    options:
    -I, --include <pat>  include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude <pat>  exclude names matching the given patterns

grep [options] pattern [files]::
    Search revisions of files for a regular expression.

    This command behaves differently than Unix grep.  It only accepts
    Python/Perl regexps.  It searches repository history, not the
    working directory.  It always prints the revision number in which
    a match appears.

    By default, grep only prints output for the first revision of a
    file in which it finds a match.  To get it to print every revision
    that contains a change in match status ("-" for a match that
    becomes a non-match, or "+" for a non-match that becomes a match),
    use the --every-match flag.

    options:
    -0, --print0              end fields with NUL
    -I, --include <pat>       include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude <pat>       exclude names matching the given patterns
    -e, --every-match         print every revision that matches
    -i, --ignore-case         ignore case when matching
    -l, --files-with-matches  print only file names and revs that match
    -n, --line-number         print matching line numbers
    -r <rev>, --rev <rev>     search in given revision range
    -u, --user                print user who committed change

heads::
    Show all repository head changesets.
    
    Repository "heads" are changesets that don't have children
    changesets. They are where development generally takes place and
    are the usual targets for update and merge operations.

identify::
    Print a short summary of the current state of the repo.
    
    This summary identifies the repository state using one or two parent
    hash identifiers, followed by a "+" if there are uncommitted changes
    in the working directory, followed by a list of tags for this revision.

    aliases: id

import [-p <n> -b <base> -f] <patches>::
    Import a list of patches and commit them individually.

    If a patch looks like a mail message (its first line starts with
    "From " or looks like an RFC822 header), it will not be applied
    unless the -m option is used.  The importer neither parses nor
    discards mail headers, so use -m only to override the "mailness"
    safety check, not to import a real mail message.

    options:
    -p, --strip <n>   directory strip option for patch. This has the same
                      meaning as the corresponding patch option
    -b <path>         base directory to read patches from
    -f, --force	      skip check for outstanding uncommitted changes
    -m, --mail-like   apply a patch that appears to be a mail message

    aliases: patch

incoming [source]::
    Show new changesets found in the specified repo or the default
    pull repo. These are the changesets that would be pulled if a pull
    was requested.

    Currently only local repositories are supported.

    aliases: in

init [dest]::
    Initialize a new repository in the given directory.  If the given
    directory does not exist, it is created.

    If no directory is given, the current directory is used.

locate [options] [files]::
    Print all files under Mercurial control whose names match the
    given patterns.

    This command searches the current directory and its
    subdirectories.  To search an entire repository, move to the root
    of the repository.

    If no patterns are given to match, this command prints all file
    names.

    If you want to feed the output of this command into the "xargs"
    command, use the "-0" option to both this command and "xargs".
    This will avoid the problem of "xargs" treating single filenames
    that contain white space as multiple file names.

    options:

    -0, --print0         end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs
    -f, --fullpath       print complete paths from the filesystem root
    -I, --include <pat>  include names matching the given patterns
    -r, --rev <rev>      search the repository as it stood at rev
    -X, --exclude <pat>  exclude names matching the given patterns

log [-r revision ...] [-p] [files]::
    Print the revision history of the specified files or the entire project.

    By default this command outputs: changeset id and hash, tags,
    parents, user, date and time, and a summary for each commit. The
    -v switch adds some more detail, such as changed files, manifest
    hashes or message signatures.

    options:
    -I, --include <pat>   include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude <pat>   exclude names matching the given patterns
    -r, --rev <A>         show the specified revision or range
    -p, --patch           show patch

    aliases: history

manifest [revision]::
    Print a list of version controlled files for the given revision.

    The manifest is the list of files being version controlled. If no revision
    is given then the tip is used.

outgoing [dest]:: 
    Show changesets not found in the specified destination repo or the
    default push repo. These are the changesets that would be pushed
    if a push was requested.

    aliases: out

parents::
    Print the working directory's parent revisions.

paths [NAME]::
    Show definition of symbolic path name NAME. If no name is given, show
    definition of available names.

    Path names are defined in the [paths] section of /etc/mercurial/hgrc
    and $HOME/.hgrc.  If run inside a repository, .hg/hgrc is used, too.

pull <repository path>::
    Pull changes from a remote repository to a local one.

    This finds all changes from the repository at the specified path
    or URL and adds them to the local repository. By default, this
    does not update the copy of the project in the working directory.

    Valid URLs are of the form:

      local/filesystem/path
      http://[user@]host[:port][/path]
      https://[user@]host[:port][/path]
      ssh://[user@]host[:port][/path]

    SSH requires an accessible shell account on the destination
    machine and a copy of hg in the remote path.
      
    options:
    -u, --update   update the working directory to tip after pull
    -e, --ssh    specify ssh command to use
    --remotecmd  specify hg command to run on the remote side

push <destination>::
    Push changes from the local repository to the given destination.
    
    This is the symmetrical operation for pull. It helps to move
    changes from the current repository to a different one. If the
    destination is local this is identical to a pull in that directory
    from the current one.

    By default, push will refuse to run if it detects the result would
    increase the number of remote heads. This generally indicates the
    the client has forgotten to sync and merge before pushing.

    Valid URLs are of the form:

      local/filesystem/path
      ssh://[user@]host[:port][/path]
      
    SSH requires an accessible shell account on the destination
    machine and a copy of hg in the remote path.

    options:

    -f, --force  force update
    -e, --ssh    specify ssh command to use
    --remotecmd  specify hg command to run on the remote side

rawcommit [-p -d -u -F -m -l]::
    Lowlevel commit, for use in helper scripts.
    
    This command is not intended to be used by normal users, as it is
    primarily useful for importing from other SCMs.

recover::
    Recover from an interrupted commit or pull.
    
    This command tries to fix the repository status after an interrupted
    operation. It should only be necessary when Mercurial suggests it.

remove [options] [files ...]::
    Schedule the indicated files for removal from the repository.
    
    This command schedules the files to be removed at the next commit.
    This only removes files from the current branch, not from the
    entire project history.

    aliases: rm

revert [names ...]::
    Revert any uncommitted modifications made to the named files or
    directories.  This restores the contents of the affected files to
    an unmodified state.

    If a file has been deleted, it is recreated.  If the executable
    mode of a file was changed, it is reset.

    If a directory is given, all files in that directory and its
    subdirectories are reverted.

    If no arguments are given, all files in the current directory and
    its subdirectories are reverted.

    options:
    -r, --rev <rev>       revision to revert to
    -n, --nonrecursive    do not recurse into subdirectories

root::
    Print the root directory of the current repository.

serve [options]::
    Start a local HTTP repository browser and pull server.

    By default, the server logs accesses to stdout and errors to
    stderr.  Use the "-A" and "-E" options to log to files.

    options:
    -A, --accesslog <file>   name of access log file to write to
    -E, --errorlog <file>    name of error log file to write to
    -a, --address <addr>     address to use
    -p, --port <n>           port to use (default: 8000)
    -n, --name <name>        name to show in web pages (default: working dir)
    -t, --templatedir <path> web templates to use
    -6, --ipv6               use IPv6 in addition to IPv4

status [options] [files]::
    Show changed files in the working directory.  If no names are
    given, all files are shown.  Otherwise, only files matching the
    given names are shown.

    The codes used to show the status of files are:
    
    M = changed
    A = added
    R = removed
    ? = not tracked

    options:

    -m, --modified       show only modified files
    -a, --added          show only added files
    -r, --removed        show only removed files
    -u, --unknown        show only unknown (not tracked) files
    -n, --no-status      hide status prefix
    -0, --print0         end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs
    -I, --include <pat>  include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude <pat>  exclude names matching the given patterns

tag [-l -m <text> -d <datecode> -u <user>] <name> [revision]::
    Name a particular revision using <name>.
    
    Tags are used to name particular revisions of the repository and are
    very useful to compare different revision, to go back to significant
    earlier versions or to mark branch points as releases, etc.
    
    If no revision is given, the tip is used.

    To facilitate version control, distribution, and merging of tags,
    they are stored as a file named ".hgtags" which is managed
    similarly to other project files and can be hand-edited if
    necessary.

    options:
    -l, --local           make the tag local
    -m, --message <text>  message for tag commit log entry
    -d, --date <datecode> datecode for commit
    -u, --user <user>     user for commit

    Note: Local tags are not version-controlled or distributed and are
    stored in the .hg/localtags file. If there exists a local tag and
    a public tag with the same name, local tag is used.

tags::
    List the repository tags.

    This lists both regular and local tags.

tip::
    Show the tip revision.

undo::
    Undo the last commit or pull transaction.

    Roll back the last pull or commit transaction on the
    repository, restoring the project to its earlier state.

    This command should be used with care. There is only one level of
    undo and there is no redo.

    This command is not intended for use on public repositories. Once
    a change is visible for pull by other users, undoing it locally is
    ineffective.

update [-m -C] [revision]::
    Update the working directory to the specified revision.

    By default, update will refuse to run if doing so would require
    merging or discarding local changes.

    With the -m option, a merge will be performed.

    With the -C option, local changes will be lost.
    
    options:
    -m, --merge       allow merging of branches
    -C, --clean       overwrite locally modified files

    aliases: up checkout co

verify::
    Verify the integrity of the current repository.

    This will perform an extensive check of the repository's
    integrity, validating the hashes and checksums of each entry in
    the changelog, manifest, and tracked files, as well as the
    integrity of their crosslinks and indices.

FILE NAME PATTERNS
------------------

    Mercurial accepts several notations for identifying one or more
    file at a time.

    By default, Mercurial treats file names as shell-style extended
    glob patterns.

    Alternate pattern notations must be specified explicitly.

    To use a plain path name without any pattern matching, start a
    name with "path:".  These path names must match completely, from
    the root of the current repository.

    To use an extended glob, start a name with "glob:".  Globs are
    rooted at the current directory; a glob such as "*.c" will match
    files ending in ".c" in the current directory only.

    The supported glob syntax extensions are "**" to match any string
    across path separators, and "{a,b}" to mean "a or b".

    To use a Perl/Python regular expression, start a name with "re:".
    Regexp pattern matching is anchored at the root of the repository.

    Plain examples:

    path:foo/bar   a name bar in a directory named foo in the root of
                   the repository
    path:path:name a file or directory named "path:name"

    Glob examples:

    glob:*.c       any name ending in ".c" in the current directory
    *.c            any name ending in ".c" in the current directory
    **.c           any name ending in ".c" in the current directory, or
                   any subdirectory
    foo/*.c        any name ending in ".c" in the directory foo
    foo/**.c       any name ending in ".c" in the directory foo, or any
                   subdirectory

    Regexp examples:

    re:.*\.c$      any name ending in ".c", anywhere in the repository


SPECIFYING SINGLE REVISIONS
---------------------------

    Mercurial accepts several notations for identifying individual
    revisions.

    A plain integer is treated as a revision number.  Negative
    integers are treated as offsets from the tip, with -1 denoting the
    tip.

    A 40-digit hexadecimal string is treated as a unique revision
    identifier.

    A hexadecimal string less than 40 characters long is treated as a
    unique revision identifier, and referred to as a short-form
    identifier.  A short-form identifier is only valid if it is the
    prefix of one full-length identifier.

    Any other string is treated as a tag name, which is a symbolic
    name associated with a revision identifier.  Tag names may not
    contain the ":" character.

    The reserved name "tip" is a special tag that always identifies
    the most recent revision.

SPECIFYING MULTIPLE REVISIONS
-----------------------------

    When Mercurial accepts more than one revision, they may be
    specified individually, or provided as a continuous range,
    separated by the ":" character.

    The syntax of range notation is [BEGIN]:[END], where BEGIN and END
    are revision identifiers.  Both BEGIN and END are optional.  If
    BEGIN is not specified, it defaults to revision number 0.  If END
    is not specified, it defaults to the tip.  The range ":" thus
    means "all revisions".

    If BEGIN is greater than END, revisions are treated in reverse
    order.

    A range acts as a closed interval.  This means that a range of 3:5
    gives 3, 4 and 5.  Similarly, a range of 4:2 gives 4, 3, and 2.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------

HGEDITOR::
    This is the name of the editor to use when committing. Defaults to the
    value of EDITOR. 

    (deprecated, use .hgrc)

HGMERGE::
    An executable to use for resolving merge conflicts. The program
    will be executed with three arguments: local file, remote file,
    ancestor file.

    The default program is "hgmerge", which is a shell script provided
    by Mercurial with some sensible defaults.

    (deprecated, use .hgrc)

HGUSER::
    This is the string used for the author of a commit.

    (deprecated, use .hgrc)

EMAIL::
    If HGUSER is not set, this will be used as the author for a commit.

LOGNAME::
    If neither HGUSER nor EMAIL is set, LOGNAME will be used (with
    '@hostname' appended) as the author value for a commit.

EDITOR::
    This is the name of the editor used in the hgmerge script. It will be
    used for commit messages if HGEDITOR isn't set. Defaults to 'vi'.

PYTHONPATH::
    This is used by Python to find imported modules and may need to be set
    appropriately if Mercurial is not installed system-wide.

FILES
-----
 .hgignore::
    This file contains regular expressions (one per line) that describe file
    names that should be ignored by hg.

 .hgtags::
    This file contains changeset hash values and text tag names (one of each
    separated by spaces) that correspond to tagged versions of the repository
    contents.

 /etc/mercurial/hgrc, $HOME/.hgrc, .hg/hgrc::
    This file contains defaults and configuration. Values in .hg/hgrc
    override those in $HOME/.hgrc, and these override settings made in the
    global /etc/mercurial/hgrc configuration.  See hgrc(5) for details of
    the contents and format of these files.

BUGS
----
Probably lots, please post them to the mailing list (See Resources below)
when you find them.
