NAME
----
hgrc - configuration files for Mercurial

SYNOPSIS
--------

The Mercurial system uses a set of configuration files to control
aspects of its behaviour.

FILES
-----

Mercurial reads configuration data from three files:

/etc/mercurial/hgrc::
    Options in this global configuration file apply to all Mercurial
    commands executed by any user in any directory.

$HOME/.hgrc::
    Per-user configuration options that apply to all Mercurial commands,
    no matter from which directory they are run.  Values in this file
    override global settings.

<repo>/.hg/hgrc::
    Per-repository configuration options that only apply in a
    particular repository.  This file is not version-controlled, and
    will not get transferred during a "clone" operation.  Values in
    this file override global and per-user settings.

SYNTAX
------

A configuration file consists of sections, led by a "[section]" header
and followed by "name: value" entries; "name=value" is also accepted.

    [spam]
    eggs=ham
    green=
       eggs

Each line contains one entry.  If the lines that follow are indented,
they are treated as continuations of that entry.

Leading whitespace is removed from values.  Empty lines are skipped.

The optional values can contain format strings which refer to other
values in the same section, or values in a special DEFAULT section.

Lines beginning with "#" or ";" are ignored and may be used to provide
comments.

SECTIONS
--------

This section describes the different sections that may appear in a
Mercurial "hgrc" file, the purpose of each section, its possible
keys, and their possible values.

decode/encode::
  Filters for transforming files on checkout/checkin. This would
  typically be used for newline processing or other
  localization/canonicalization of files.

  Filters consist of a filter pattern followed by a filter command.
  The command must accept data on stdin and return the transformed
  data on stdout.

  Example:

    [encode]
    # uncompress gzip files on checkin to improve delta compression
    # note: not necessarily a good idea, just an example
    *.gz = gunzip

    [decode]
    # recompress gzip files when writing them to the working dir
    *.gz = gzip

hooks::

  starting or finishing a commit.
  changegroup;;

  commit;;
    Run after a changeset has been created. Passed the ID of the newly

  precommit;;
    Run before starting a commit.  Exit status 0 allows the commit to

  proxy.
