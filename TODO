General:
- Better documentation
- More regression tests
- More specific try/except.
- less code duplication, more code in the right places
- python 2.2 support
- better import support
- export to git
- Add standard files: AUTHORS, CREDITS, COPYING. ChangeLog? What else?

Core:
- difflib creating/removing files (fixed except dates: should be epoch)
- directory foo.d or foo.i with existing file foo (use some quoting?)
- get various options from hgrc (e.g. history always -v, tip always -q)
- allow full decimal (part of) hash
  hg export 5005048662 -> OverflowError: long int too large to convert
  to int
- push support (hack exists)
- hg over ssh://
- commit mailinglist/trigger/hooks
- fast diff extension

Commands:
- hg status <filename>: file rev, changeset rev, changed, added,
  deleted, sha-1
- select to pull a subset of the heads
- commands.py: number of args too much magic (e.g. in patch())
- adding a tag with "hg tag foobar"
- automatic pull fallback to old-http://
- hg init|pull http://example.com doesn't say that no repo was found
- hg annotate -u and hgweb annotate with long $EMAIL
- hg -v history doesn't show tkmerge as modified (removed).
- hg import vs. hg patch in help etc. (import is a reserved python
  word)
- version reporting (hg --version / version.py / setup.py etc.)
- hg pull default in a subdir doesn't work, if it is a relative path
- show tags in hg history
- optionally only show merges (two parents or parent != changeset-1, etc.)

Web:
- show tags in hgweb
- show parent changeset number in hgweb
- optionally only show merges (two parents or parent != changeset-1, etc.)
- one hgweb with many repos (another script)
- hgweb tip link too verbose
- hgweb: deliver static files (e.g. favicon, stylesheets)
- hgweb personalization: timezone (display/change), display of
  features
- hg export 240 shows -tkmerge (good), hgweb does not (bad).
- some web servers think hgweb.cgi.[di] is a CGI script with old-http://
  (use quoting (see foo.d in Core) or document server configurations?)
- link children in hgweb
