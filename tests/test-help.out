hg add [OPTION]... [FILE]...

add the specified files on the next commit

    Schedule files to be version controlled and added to the repository.

    The files will be added to the repository at the next commit.

    If no names are given, add all files in the repository.

options:

 -I --include  include names matching the given patterns
 -X --exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns
 -n --dry-run  do not perform actions, just print output
hg add: option --skjdfks not recognized
hg add [OPTION]... [FILE]...

add the specified files on the next commit

    Schedule files to be version controlled and added to the repository.

    The files will be added to the repository at the next commit.

    If no names are given, add all files in the repository.

options:

 -I --include  include names matching the given patterns
 -X --exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns
 -n --dry-run  do not perform actions, just print output
hg diff [-a] [-I] [-X] [-r REV1 [-r REV2]] [FILE]...

diff repository (or selected files)

    Show differences between revisions for the specified files.

    Differences between files are shown using the unified diff format.

    When two revision arguments are given, then changes are shown
    between those revisions. If only one revision is specified then
    that revision is compared to the working directory, and, when no
    revisions are specified, the working directory files are compared
    to its parent.

    Without the -a option, diff will avoid generating diffs of files
    it detects as binary. With -a, diff will generate a diff anyway,
    probably with undesirable results.

options:

 -r --rev                  revision
 -a --text                 treat all files as text
 -p --show-function        show which function each change is in
 -g --git                  use git extended diff format
 -w --ignore-all-space     ignore white space when comparing lines
 -b --ignore-space-change  ignore changes in the amount of white space
 -B --ignore-blank-lines   ignore changes whose lines are all blank
 -I --include              include names matching the given patterns
 -X --exclude              exclude names matching the given patterns
hg status [OPTION]... [FILE]...

show changed files in the working directory

    Show status of files in the repository.  If names are given, only
    files that match are shown.  Files that are clean or ignored, are
    not listed unless -c (clean), -i (ignored) or -A is given.

    The codes used to show the status of files are:
    M = modified
    A = added
    R = removed
    C = clean
    ! = deleted, but still tracked
    ? = not tracked
    I = ignored (not shown by default)
      = the previous added file was copied from here

aliases: st

options:

 -A --all        show status of all files
 -m --modified   show only modified files
 -a --added      show only added files
 -r --removed    show only removed files
 -d --deleted    show only deleted (but tracked) files
 -c --clean      show only files without changes
 -u --unknown    show only unknown (not tracked) files
 -i --ignored    show ignored files
 -n --no-status  hide status prefix
 -C --copies     show source of copied files
 -0 --print0     end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs
 -I --include    include names matching the given patterns
 -X --exclude    exclude names matching the given patterns
hg status [OPTION]... [FILE]...
