hg add [OPTION]... [FILE]...

add the specified files on the next commit

    Schedule files to be version controlled and added to the repository.

    The files will be added to the repository at the next commit. To undo an
    add before that, see hg forget.

    If no names are given, add all files to the repository.

options:

 -I --include  include names matching the given patterns
 -X --exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns
 -n --dry-run  do not perform actions, just print output

use "hg -v help add" to show global options
hg add: option --skjdfks not recognized

hg diff [OPTION]... [-r REV1 [-r REV2]] [FILE]...

diff repository (or selected files)

    Show differences between revisions for the specified files.

    Differences between files are shown using the unified diff format.

    NOTE: diff may generate unexpected results for merges, as it will default
    to comparing against the working directory's first parent changeset if no
    revisions are specified.

    When two revision arguments are given, then changes are shown between
    those revisions. If only one revision is specified then that revision is
    compared to the working directory, and, when no revisions are specified,
    the working directory files are compared to its parent.

    Without the -a/--text option, diff will avoid generating diffs of files it
    detects as binary. With -a, diff will generate a diff anyway, probably
    with undesirable results.

    Use the -g/--git option to generate diffs in the git extended diff format.
    For more information, read 'hg help diffs'.

options:

 -r --rev                  revision
 -c --change               change made by revision
 -a --text                 treat all files as text
 -g --git                  use git extended diff format
    --nodates              don't include dates in diff headers
 -p --show-function        show which function each change is in
    --reverse              produce a diff that undoes the changes
 -w --ignore-all-space     ignore white space when comparing lines
 -b --ignore-space-change  ignore changes in the amount of white space
 -B --ignore-blank-lines   ignore changes whose lines are all blank
 -U --unified              number of lines of context to show
    --stat                 output diffstat-style summary of changes
 -I --include              include names matching the given patterns
 -X --exclude              exclude names matching the given patterns

use "hg -v help diff" to show global options
hg status [OPTION]... [FILE]...

aliases: st

show changed files in the working directory

    Show status of files in the repository. If names are given, only files
    that match are shown. Files that are clean or ignored or the source of a
    copy/move operation, are not listed unless -c/--clean, -i/--ignored,
    -C/--copies or -A/--all are given. Unless options described with "show
    only ..." are given, the options -mardu are used.

    Option -q/--quiet hides untracked (unknown and ignored) files unless
    explicitly requested with -u/--unknown or -i/--ignored.

    NOTE: status may appear to disagree with diff if permissions have changed
    or a merge has occurred. The standard diff format does not report
    permission changes and diff only reports changes relative to one merge
    parent.

    If one revision is given, it is used as the base revision. If two
    revisions are given, the differences between them are shown.

    The codes used to show the status of files are:

      M = modified
      A = added
      R = removed
      C = clean
      ! = missing (deleted by non-hg command, but still tracked)
      ? = not tracked
      I = ignored
        = origin of the previous file listed as A (added)

options:

 -A --all        show status of all files
 -m --modified   show only modified files
 -a --added      show only added files
 -r --removed    show only removed files
 -d --deleted    show only deleted (but tracked) files
 -c --clean      show only files without changes
 -u --unknown    show only unknown (not tracked) files
 -i --ignored    show only ignored files
 -n --no-status  hide status prefix
 -C --copies     show source of copied files
 -0 --print0     end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs
    --rev        show difference from revision
 -I --include    include names matching the given patterns
 -X --exclude    exclude names matching the given patterns

use "hg -v help status" to show global options
hg status [OPTION]... [FILE]...
