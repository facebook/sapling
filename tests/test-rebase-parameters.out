move changeset (and descendants) to a different branch

    Rebase uses repeated merging to graft changesets from one part of history
    (the source) onto another (the destination). This can be useful for
    linearizing *local* changes relative to a master development tree.

    You should not rebase changesets that have already been shared with
    others. Doing so will force everybody else to perform the same rebase or
    they will end up with duplicated changesets after pulling in your rebased
    changesets.

    If you don't specify a destination changeset ("-d/--dest"), rebase uses
    the tipmost head of the current named branch as the destination. (The
    destination changeset is not modified by rebasing, but new changesets are
    added as its descendants.)

    You can specify which changesets to rebase in two ways: as a "source"
    changeset or as a "base" changeset. Both are shorthand for a topologically
    related set of changesets (the "source branch"). If you specify source
    ("-s/--source"), rebase will rebase that changeset and all of its
    descendants onto dest. If you specify base ("-b/--base"), rebase will
    select ancestors of base back to but not including the common ancestor
    with dest. Thus, "-b" is less precise but more convenient than "-s": you
    can specify any changeset in the source branch, and rebase will select the
    whole branch. If you specify neither "-s" nor "-b", rebase uses the parent
    of the working directory as the base.

    By default, rebase recreates the changesets in the source branch as
    descendants of dest and then destroys the originals. Use "--keep" to
    preserve the original source changesets. Some changesets in the source
    branch (e.g. merges from the destination branch) may be dropped if they no
    longer contribute any change.

    One result of the rules for selecting the destination changeset and source
    branch is that, unlike "merge", rebase will do nothing if you are at the
    latest (tipmost) head of a named branch with two heads. You need to
    explicitly specify source and/or destination (or "update" to the other
    head, if it's the head of the intended source branch).

    If a rebase is interrupted to manually resolve a merge, it can be
    continued with --continue/-c or aborted with --abort/-a.

    Returns 0 on success, 1 if nothing to rebase.

options:

 -s --source        rebase from the specified changeset
 -b --base          rebase from the base of the specified changeset (up to
                    greatest common ancestor of base and dest)

    --collapse      collapse the rebased changesets
    --keep          keep original changesets
