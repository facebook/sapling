paragraphs formatted to fit within 60 characters:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is some text in the first paragraph.

  An indented paragraph with just two lines.

The third paragraph. It is followed by some random lines
with spurious spaces.

  the indentation

literals formatted to fit within 60 characters:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The fully minimized form is the most convenient form:

Hello
  literal
    world

In the partially minimized form a paragraph simply ends with
space-double-colon.

////////////////////////////////////////
long un-wrapped line in a literal block
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

This literal block is started with '::',
  the so-called expanded form. The paragraph
    with '::' disappears in the final output.

          of an indented list.

    (The above is not a list item since we are in the literal block.)

options formatted to fit within 60 characters:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
There is support for simple option lists, but only with long
options:

--all      Output all.
--both     Output both (this description is quite long).
--long     Output all day long.
--par      This option has two paragraphs in its
           description. This is the first.

           This is the second.  Blank lines may be omitted
           between options (as above) or left in (as here).

The next paragraph looks like an option list, but lacks the
two-space marker after the option. It is treated as a normal
paragraph:

--foo bar baz
