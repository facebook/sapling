literals formatted to fit within 60 characters:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The fully minimized form is the most convenient form:

  Hello
    literal
      world

In the partially minimized form a paragraph simply ends with
space-double-colon.

  ////////////////////////////////////////
  long un-wrapped line in a literal block
  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

  This literal block is started with '::',
    the so-called expanded form. The paragraph
      with '::' disappears in the final output.

                      with an argument
 -I --include         an option with both a short option and
                      a long option
    --all             Output all.
    --both            Output both (this description is quite
                      long).
    --long            Output all day long.
    --par             This option has two paragraphs in its
