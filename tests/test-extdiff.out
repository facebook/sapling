            specified then that revision is compared to the working
            directory, and, when no revisions are specified, the
            working directory files are compared to its parent.

 -o --option   pass option to comparison program
 -r --rev      revision
 -I --include  include names matching the given patterns
 -X --exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns
