hg convert [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST [MAPFILE]]

Convert a foreign SCM repository to a Mercurial one.

    Accepted source formats:
    - Mercurial
    - CVS
    - Darcs
    - git
    - Subversion

    Accepted destination formats:
    - Mercurial

    If no revision is given, all revisions will be converted. Otherwise,
    convert will only import up to the named revision (given in a format
    understood by the source).

    If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the
    basename of the source with '-hg' appended.  If the destination
    repository doesn't exist, it will be created.

    If <MAPFILE> isn't given, it will be put in a default location
    (<dest>/.hg/shamap by default).  The <MAPFILE> is a simple text
    file that maps each source commit ID to the destination ID for
    that revision, like so:
    <source ID> <destination ID>

    If the file doesn't exist, it's automatically created.  It's updated
    on each commit copied, so convert-repo can be interrupted and can
    be run repeatedly to copy new commits.

    The [username mapping] file is a simple text file that maps each source
    commit author to a destination commit author. It is handy for source SCMs
    that use unix logins to identify authors (eg: CVS). One line per author
    mapping and the line format is:
    srcauthor=whatever string you want

    The filemap is a file that allows filtering and remapping of files
    and directories.  Comment lines start with '#'.  Each line can
    contain one of the following directives:

      include path/to/file

      exclude path/to/file

      rename from/file to/file
    
    The 'include' directive causes a file, or all files under a
    directory, to be included in the destination repository, and the
    exclusion of all other files and dirs not explicitely included.
    The 'exclude' directive causes files or directories to be omitted.
    The 'rename' directive renames a file or directory.  To rename from a
    subdirectory into the root of the repository, use '.' as the path to
    rename to.

 -A --authors      username mapping filename
