ISL shows you a tree of your commits, with each commit including information about Pull Requests, bookmarks, and more. Rather than typing commit hashes, you can directly click on commits to interact with them. For example, rebasing a commit is as simple as dragging and dropping. While ISL doesn't provide every single feature of the Sapling CLI, it is designed to simplify everyday workflows and provide an extremely clear picture of your local changes, which is often all that's needed.

This is similar to branches in Git. A commit can also have more than one commit stacked on top of it. You can drag and drop commits to rebase them. This is the easiest way to re-arrange commits and manipulate stacks.  Note that drag-and-drop rebasing is not allowed while you have uncommitted changes, since it's harder to deal with merge conflicts. Commit any uncommitted changes first to work around this.

ISL shows the arguments used to run commands, so you could replicate the behavior on the CLI if you want to.   Some commands like sl status will run automatically in the background to fetch data so the UI is always up to date. Commands will automatically queue up to be run as you interact with the UI.

With the --graph option, revisions are shown as an ASCII art graph with the most recent commit at the top.

The -L option can be specified multiple times and requires the --follow option. Currently, the line range option is not compatible with --graph and is an experimental feature. sl log --patch may generate unexpected diff output for merge commits, as it will only compare the merge commit against its first parent. Also, only files different from BOTH parents will appear in the files: section.

There is also an automation-friendly JSON input mode which allows the caller to provide the mapping between commit and new message and username in the following format: { &quot;&lt;commit_hash&gt;&quot;: { &quot;message&quot;: &quot;&lt;message&gt;&quot;, &quot;user&quot;: &quot;&lt;user&gt;&quot; // optional } }  You can specify --fold to fold multiple revisions into one when the given revisions form a linear unbroken chain. However, sl fold is the preferred command for this purpose. See sl help fold for more information.

This behavior is achieved by creating a copy of the commit at the destination and hiding the original commit. Use -k/--keep to skip the hiding and keep the original commits visible. If the commits being rebased have bookmarks, rebase moves the bookmarks onto the new versions of the commits. Bookmarks are moved even if --keepis specified. Public commits cannot be rebased unless you use the --keep option to copy them. Use the following options to select the commits you want to rebase: -r/--rev to explicitly select commits -s/--source to select a root commit and include all of its descendants -b/--base to select a commit and its ancestors and descendants If no option is specified to select commits, -b . is used by default. If --source or --rev is used, special names SRC and ALLSRCcan be used in --dest. Destination would be calculated per source revision with SRC substituted by that single source revision andALLSRC substituted by all source revisions. If multiple --revs are specified, they can be paired with multiple--dests. For example: rebase -r A+B -d X -r C::E -d Y  will rebase A+B to X, and rebase C::E to Y. If commits that you are rebasing consist entirely of changes that are already present in the destination, those commits are not moved (in other words, they are rebased out). Sometimes conflicts can occur when you rebase. When this happens, by default, Sapling launches an editor for every conflict. Conflict markers are inserted into affected files, like: &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; dest ==== source &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  To fix the conflicts, for each file, remove the markers and replace the whole block of code with the correctly merged code. If you close the editor without resolving the conflict, the rebase is interrupted and you are returned to the command line. At this point, you can resolve conflicts in manual resolution mode. See sl help resolve for details. After manually resolving conflicts, resume the rebase withsl rebase --continue. If you are not able to successfully resolve all conflicts, run sl rebase --abort to abort the rebase. Alternatively, you can use a custom merge tool to automate conflict resolution. To specify a custom merge tool, use the --tool flag. Seesl help merge-tools for a list of available tools and for information about configuring the default merge behavior. Examples: Move a single commit to master: sl rebase -r 5f493448 -d master  Move a commit and all its descendants to another part of the commit graph: sl rebase --source c0c3 --dest 4cf9  Rebase everything on a local branch marked by a bookmark to master: sl rebase --base myfeature --dest master  Rebase orphaned commits onto the latest version of their parents: sl rebase --restack  Configuration Options: By default, rebase will close the transaction after each commit. For performance purposes, you can configure rebase to use a single transaction across the entire rebase. WARNING: This setting introduces a significant risk of losing the work you've done in a rebase if the rebase aborts unexpectedly: [rebase] singletransaction = True  By default, rebase writes to the working copy, but you can configure it to run in-memory for for better performance, and to allow it to run if the current checkout is dirty: [rebase] experimental.inmemory = True  It will also print a configurable warning: [rebase] experimental.inmemorywarning = Using experimental in-memory rebase  Returns 0 on success (also when nothing to rebase), 1 if there are unresolved conflicts.

Files that are unmodified, ignored, or the source of a copy/move operation are not listed. To control the exact statuses that are shown, specify the relevant flags (like -rd to show only files that are removed or deleted). Additionally, specify -q/--quiet to hide both unknown and ignored files. To show the status of specific files, provide a list of files to match. To include or exclude files using patterns or filesets, use-I or -X. If --rev is specified and only one revision is given, it is used as the base revision. If two revisions are given, the differences between them are shown. The --change option can also be used as a shortcut to list the changed files of a revision from its first parent. sl status might appear to disagree with sl diff if permissions have changed or a merge has occurred, because the standard diff format does not report permission changes and sl diff only reports changes relative to one merge parent. The -t/--terse option abbreviates the output by showing only the directory name if all the files in it share the same status. The option takes an argument indicating the statuses to abbreviate: 'm' for 'modified', 'a' for 'added', 'r' for 'removed', 'd' for 'deleted', 'u' for 'unknown', 'i' for 'ignored' and 'c' for clean. It abbreviates only those statuses which are passed. Note that clean and ignored files are not displayed with --terse ic unless the -c/--cleanand -i/--ignored options are also used. The -v/--verbose option shows information when the repository is in an unfinished merge, shelve, rebase state, etc. You can have this behavior turned on by default by enabling the commands.status.verbose config option.

When revisions are fetched on demand, if a later revision was fetched first, then it's impossible to append an older (ancestor) revision.Lookup by hash can trigger a linear scan. The slowness this causes becomes noticeable when there are lots of revisions. It can be worked around by building separate indexes.Not general purpose enough to fit various use-cases. For example, theobsstore would require looking up a record by various indexes: predecessors or successors, and one record can have multiple predecessors or successors. In Revlog, one record can only have one SHA1 hash as its key. Git's format (loose and pack files) does not have the topological order limitation, and lookup by hash is ideally O(log N), unless there are too many pack files. But it requires periodical repack to maintain performance, and does not support the multi-index use-case. SQLite is a powerful library that satisfies the multi-index use-cases, and can maintain time complexity without &quot;repack&quot;. However, the main problem is that historically we use the &quot;append-only&quot; strategy to achieve lock-free reads, but SQLite requires locking for both read and write. IndexedLog is built to achieve the following desired properties: O(log N) lookup and does not require repack to maintain performance.Insertion by hash without topological order limitation.Lock-free reading which primarily means &quot;append-only larger files&quot; and &quot;atomic-replace small files&quot; using the filesystem APIs we have today.

These commits are public and cannot be modified.Sapling also tracks a set of visible heads. Any commit that is an ancestor of a visible head is visible. These commits are draft, and may be modified by commands like sl amend.

While most visibility operations are automatic, you can also manually hide and unhide commits using the sl hide and sl unhide commands.

The records of these changes are called mutations. This is similar to some parts of the Evolve extension of Mercurial, however it is designed to be more lightweight to allow scaling to very large repositories with millions of modified commits. A mutation record is a record of how a modified commit came to exist. For example, if you run sl amend on commit A to produce commit B, Sapling will store a record that says &quot;commit B was created by amending commit A&quot;. It will also record who performed the mutation, and the timestamp. For the most part, mutation records are purely informational. They affect Sapling operations in two ways: In smartlog, if both a commit that has been modified and its modified version are visible, the earlier commit will show as obsolete and the latest version's hash will be shown next to the commit, along with whatever operation caused the modification.When restacking commits after modifying a commit in the middle of stack, Sapling will use the mutation information of a commit's parent to determine the latest commits that should be used as the destination for each restack. You can also find earlier and later versions of a commit using the predecessors and successors revsets. When used with the Sapling server, commit mutation information can be shared with other developers working on the same commits. When pushing or pulling draft commits to or from the server, Sapling includes records covering the full mutation history of the pushed or pulled commits. It's not necessary for the older commits themselves to be shared, as Sapling can skip over commits in the history that are not present in the local repository. In order for this to scale to thousands of developers making millions of changes, Sapling only considers mutation records in the mutation history of the draft commits that you are currently working on, i.e., those that are visible in your local repository.

The list of differences below is not comprehensive, nor is it meant to be a competitive comparison of Mercurial and Sapling. It just highlights some interesting differences for curious people who are already familiar with Mercurial. Many of the differences from Git also apply to Mercurial and that list should be referred to as well. Sapling has substantial scaling, implementation, and format differences as well that are not covered here. Sapling has different default behavior and options for many commands.​ Sapling removes or changes the behavior of a number of Mercurial commands in order to make the behavior more consistent with modern expectations. For instance, in Sapling ‘sl log’ by default shows the history from your current commit. In Mercurial hg log shows the history of the entire repository at once. Features that are off by default in Mercurial, like rebase, are enabled by default in Sapling. Sapling has no “named branches”.​ In Mercurial, a user may create bookmarks or branches. In Sapling, there are only bookmarks. “Named Branches” in the Mercurial sense do not exist. Sapling has remote bookmarks.​ In Mercurial, there are only local bookmarks which are synchronized with the server during push and pull. In Sapling, there are local bookmarks which only ever exist locally, and there are remote bookmarks, such as remote/main, which are immutable local representations of the location of the server bookmark at the time of the last sl pull. Sapling allows hiding/unhiding commits.​ In Mercurial, to remove a commit you must either strip the commit entirely, or use an extension like “Evolve” to semi-permanently prune the commit. In Sapling, commits are never removed/stripped from your repository and can easily be hidden/unhidden at will. Sapling makes editing commits a first-class operation.​ The original Mercurial design avoided editing commits. While later extensions added some ability to edit commits (rebase, amend, strip, etc), it can still feel like a second-class feature. Sapling treats editing commits as a first-class concept and provides a variety of commands for manipulating commits and recovering from manipulation mistakes. Similarities to Mercurial Sapling supports the same revset and template features as Mercurial.​ Revsets and templates largely work the same as they do in Mercurial.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Differences from Git","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/introduction/differences-git","content":"Differences from Git While Sapling is similar to Git in that it is distributed, uses hash-addressed commits, has branches (called bookmarks), and uses a clone/pull/push/commit/rebase model, there are a number of behavioral differences. The list of differences below is not comprehensive, nor is it meant to be a competitive comparison of Git and Sapling. Rather, it highlights some interesting differences for curious people who are already familiar with Git. Sapling has substantial scaling differences as well, which are not covered here. Sapling does not require or encourage using named local branches.​ In Git, your repository is defined by the location of your branches, and you pretty much must be on a local branch whenever you do work. In addition, any amend/rebase you do to one branch has no impact on any other branch. In Sapling, local bookmarks (the equivalent to a Git branch) are completely optional and generally not even used. You do have &quot;branches&quot; in the sense that you can make a stack of commits that fork off the main line of the commit graph, but there is no need to put a label on it. All of your commits are easily visible in your “smartlog” and can be accessed via its hash. Instead of deleting a branch to delete commits, you can “hide” and “unhide” commits. Not requiring bookmarks simplifies the mental model of the repo and has generally been well regarded by our users. Local bookmarks may still be used as a convenient label for commits, but note that rebasing a commit will move all local bookmarks along with the commit. Remote bookmarks are still required and are locally immutable, similar to origin/main in Git. Sapling has no staging area.​ In Git, you must add changes to the staging area before you commit them. This can be used to commit/amend just part of your changes. In Sapling, there is no staging area. If you want to commit/amend just part of your changes you can use commit/amend -i to interactively choose which changes to commit/amend. Alternatively, you can simulate a staging area by making a temporary commit and amending to it as if it was the staging area, then use fold to collapse it into the real commit. Sapling may not download all the repository data during clone/pull.​ In Git, a clone or pull will generally fetch all new repository data. In Sapling, a clone or pull will only fetch the main branches of a repo. Other branches will be fetched on demand. push only updates one remote branch. When used with a supported server, Sapling might fetch commit data (messages, date, or even hashes), tree and file data on demand. These avoid downloading unnecessary data, at the cost of requiring the user to be online more often. Sapling has first-class support for undo commands.​ In Git, to undo many operations requires a deeper understanding of the Git commit model and how git checkout/reset/reflog interact with that model. In Sapling, there are uncommit, unamend, unhide, and undo commands for undoing common operations. Additionally, undo -i allows you to go back across multiple operations and gives a visual preview of the post-undo state of the repository before you do it. Sapling does not use rebase -i for editing stacked commits.​ In Git, when working with a stack of commits, you are generally required to use git rebase -i to edit commits in the middle of the stack, which is a notably complex flow. In Sapling, when working with a stack of commits you can just checkout the commit you want to work on and run “amend”, “split”, “fold”, etc to modify the middle of the stack. The top of the stack is automatically kept track of and restacked for you so your stack remains together. Additionally, absorb allows automatically sucking pending changes down into the appropriate commit in your stack. histedit can be used to provide a rebase -i like experience if desired. Sapling generally does one thing per command.​ In Git, a command may do multiple seemingly unrelated things. checkout may be used to move to another commit, revert the contents of an individual file, and create a branch. reset may be used to move a branch and undo certain operations. rebase can be used to move commits or edit a stack. In Sapling, each command generally does one thing. pull fetches remote commits without merging. goto moves you to another commit. revert adjusts the contents of files in the working copy. bookmark create a bookmark. rebase moves commits, etc. Sapling allows pushing “onto” a bookmark (when used with a Sapling compatible server).​ In Git, pushing involves sending your commits to the server and updating the server branches to point at the new commits. In Sapling, when used with a Sapling compatible server, a push sends your commits to the server then the server rebases your commit onto the target bookmark (as long as the rebase would not require merging file changes) and moves the target bookmark forward. This allows many pushes to succeed at once, without requiring people to pull-then-rebase-then-push again to win a push race. Sapling supports “sparse profiles” for sharing sparse configuration (when not using the Sapling virtual filesystem).​ In Git, users are responsible for manually managing their own sparse configuration. In Sapling, sparse configuration can be checked into the repo as a &quot;sparse profile&quot; file which lists all the paths to include/exclude. This allows all users on a team or in an org to use the same sparse profile. As dependencies change, the shared profile can be updated so that everyone always has the correct files without every engineer having to update their setup. Sapling tracks the history of a commit as it’s changed over time.​ In Git, if you amend or rebase a file, there is no record that the new version of the commit came from the old version. In Sapling, when you modify a commit via operations such as amend, rebase, fold, or split, the record of the operation is kept which allows you to view the mutation history of that commit. This history is used to automate certain rebases for you: for instance, if you have a stack of five commits and the first commit gets rebased and pushed to main by your CI system, Sapling will know that your local commit #1 became commit X in main and can automatically rebase commits 2-5 onto the new main version. The record of the mutations becomes particularly powerful when working across multiple machines or with multiple people on a stack, as it allows the stack to stay together even as different people/machines edit different parts of it.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Sapling SCM","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/introduction/","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Why make a new version control?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Sapling SCM","url":"/docs/introduction/#why-make-a-new-version-control","content":"Sapling began 10 years ago as an effort to make Meta’s monorepo scale in the face of ever increasing engineering growth. Publicly available source control systems were not, and still are not, capable of handling repositories of this size. Instead of moving away from the monorepo and sacrificing engineering velocity, we decided to build the source control system we needed. Along the way we realized there were also large opportunities to increase developer velocity by improving the source control experience. By investing in new UX, we’ve made it possible for even new engineers to understand their repository and do things that were previously only possible for power users. Additionally, as we developed Sapling we ended up with internal abstractions that happened to make it straightforward for us to add Git support. This idea that the UX and scale of your version control could be separated from the repository format has allowed us to, in effect, have our cake and eat it too by letting us use our scalable system internally, and still interact with Git repositories where needed. We hope that this pattern might also provide an example path for how source control could evolve beyond the current industry wide status quo.

Reviewing overlapping pull requests on GitHub can be confusing, so we also provide ReviewStack as an alternative code review tool that handles these kinds of pull requests better. After you have created an initial series of pull requests using pr, you will likely make local changes to your commits that need to be submitted for review. To publish these local changes to GitHub, simply run pr again to update your existing PRs. Note if you have introduced new commits in your stack that are not linked to a PR, pr will create pull requests for those, as well.

While Sapling contains a variety of commands to help you undo mistakes, its foundational feature is that commits can be hidden and unhidden, and that doing so is safe, easy to understand, and easy to undo. While commits can be hidden manually, they can also become hidden when they are superceded by changes to the commit, whether by amends, rebases, or other operations. But the key concept is that they are still stored permanently in your repository, even after they are no longer visible in your smartlog output. If you ever want to bring back an old commit, it’s as easy as sl unhide. And with a robust sl undo command, you can quickly and easily get to a previous state. Being able to undo just about any command gives users the confidence to try new commands and learn from their mistakes. sl hide COMMIT and sl unhide COMMIT can be used to simply and safely hide and recover commits. $ sl @ b84224608 Yesterday at 16:04 john remote/main │ Updating submodules ~ $ sl unhide 15de72785 $ sl @ b84224608 Yesterday at 16:04 john remote/main ╷ Updating submodules ╷ ╷ o 15de72785 Yesterday at 16:16 mary ╭─╯ Implement glorious features │ o a555d064c Wednesday at 09:06 │ ~ # Note, a555d064c was not unhidden.

You cannot hide commits on bookmarks that came from the server (known as “public” commits).If you hide a commit that has commits on top of it (that is, its descendants), all of the commits will be hidden. If you unhide a commit that has commits beneath it (that is, its ancestors), all of the commits will be unhidden.You can hide/unhide many commits at once using revsets (see sl help revset). For instance, sl hide &quot;draft()&quot; will hide all of your local commits.Many commands work even on hidden commits. For instance, sl show COMMIT will let you inspect a commit before unhiding it. You can even checkout a hidden commit to temporarily work with it.Hiding a commit will also remove any local bookmarks on that commit. There is currently no way to permanently delete a commit from your local repository other than by deleting your repo and recloning. How to find a hidden commit​ There are a variety of ways to find which hidden commit you want to unhide. sl smartlog --rev &quot;hidden()&quot; to view all hidden commits using the “hidden()” revset.sl log -r &quot;predecessors(COMMIT)&quot; to view the hidden previous versions of a certain commit (that is, the version from before a rebase, amend, etc).See Undo and Journal for more ways to view your past repository actions.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Basic commands","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/overview/basic-commands","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Working with commits​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Basic commands","url":"/docs/overview/basic-commands#working-with-commits","content":"Get\tView\tChange\tMove\tRemove\tFix\tStackclone\tsl\tamend\trebase\thide\tuncommit\tfold pull\tshow\tmetaedit\tgraft\tunhide\tunamend\tsplit log undo\tabsorb web redo\thistedit restack ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Working with your checkout​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Basic commands","url":"/docs/overview/basic-commands#working-with-your-checkout","content":"View\tMove\tChange\tFix\tSavestatus\tgoto\tadd\trevert\tcommit diff\tnext\tremove\tclean\tshelve prev\tforget move copy  Examples Many of Sapling’s basic commands will be familiar, and perhaps even unremarkable, to existing Git and Mercurial users.

When sl push is used with the Sapling server, sl push --to BOOKMARK pushes the commits to the server and the server additionally rebases them onto the destination bookmark. This allows organizations with high push rates to avoid races where someone is unable to push because someone else pushed first. This server side rebase is simplified, in that it does not do any file content merging.

This affects a wide variety of performance characteristics: Storing all the commit data (messages, author, metadata, etc.) can take gigabytes of space. Note, this does not include the cost of storing file and tree data.Running sl log with particular constraints may have to read a large number of commits.Common graph queries, like ‘common ancestor’, used in many commands, like smartlog and rebase, can become slow.Computing the shortest unique hash prefix to provide pleasing UI output can become expensive. Sapling takes several approaches to handle this: History data (i.e. the graph relationships) and commit metadata (i.e. messages, authors, etc) are stored separately. This allows us to download lots of history data for graph computations, while downloading a more limited amount of commit metadata.Commit metadata is downloaded lazily. When you first clone a repository, no commit messages are downloaded. Only once you start inspecting commits, via smartlog, show, etc, individual commit metadata is downloaded as needed. This makes clones fast, and reduces the amount of disk space required to O(commits you are interested in).History data is stored using the Segmented Changelog. This is a data structure that represents the shape of the entire commit graph using segments to concisely represent large swaths of history. The segmented changelog can be represented in just a few megabytes and can answer graph query questions in O(number-of-merges) time, or just a few milliseconds even in a large monorepo.log with certain constraints, such as trying to find all commits by a certain user, may still need to inspect a lot of commits. Sapling attempts to make log more efficient by batch-fetching commit data, in order to avoid one-by-one serial fetches. Additionally, log on files and directories has special support, discussed below.Computing the shortest unique hash for a given commit is done by maintaining an incrementally updatable tree-like index of all locally-available commit hashes.

This can cause slowness when talking to the server, as each bookmark needs to be checked, and generally clutters the local user experience. Sapling defaults to not downloading every bookmark from the server. Instead, during a clone you receive the main or master bookmark, and a configurable list of specific other bookmarks. Users can choose to subscribe to specific bookmarks via sl pull -B. Sapling also transparently downloads bookmarks if the users uses them in commands. For instance, if a user runs sl goto release_123 but they don’t have that remote bookmark, Sapling will automatically download it to complete the checkout.

In a large repository, this quantity of data may be so large that it is slow and impractical to download all of it to individual clients. Sapling, on the other hand, does not downloald tree and file data durings pull and clones. That data is left on the server, and the Sapling client downloads it on demand when later required, such as during a checkout. The on demand nature of Sapling commands requires carefully designed algorithms to ensure data is fetched efficiently and in parallel. Lazily downloading data means Sapling may need network access to perform operations that would traditionally be doable offline. To support some offline work, Sapling keeps all of the downloaded data in a local cache with a bounded size. This cache generally contains enough data to move between, inspect, commit, and amend on any of your recently in-progress commits.

For files, Sapling makes these operations O(changes to that file) by tracking the exact history of each individual file, in addition to the history of the entire commit graph. This allows log and blame to be fast, regardless of the size of the repository. For directories, Sapling also tracks the history of a directory, but using this information to answer history queries is not yet implemented. Instead, Sapling can query the Sapling server for a directory’s history, which allows using the server's superior indexes to answer the query quickly. Additionally, in the case where the server isn't available, Sapling can bisect over the Segmented Changelog structure to look for the commits that changed the given file or directory. This allows figuring out an approximate history in O(log n) time, though it may miss cases where a file or directory is changed, then reverted back to a previous version.

Rebase races In Git or Mercurial, in order to push to the main branch you must first pull and rebase/merge onto the latest main branch. If someone pushes before you, then you have to repeat the process until you win. If there are many people competing, it can become almost impossible to actually push your commit. In Sapling, when you push to the Sapling server, the server actually takes your commit and rebases it to be on the top of bookmark you are pushing to. So if someone else pushed before you, it’s ok because the server just moves your commit up to the top. If someone else edited a file you touched, then the push will fail and you must manually rebase to merge the file. There is still the potential for races where two people modify two different files in incompatible ways, but in practice this has not been an issue. Code generation races A large amount of commit throughput also introduces problems if your repository contains generated files. If you modify a file that requires regenerating, then if someone else does the same and pushes first, you need to rebase over their change and once again regenerate the files. The time taken to generate the file means the window in which you could lose the race becomes quite large, and it can become impossible to win the race if many people are changing the same generated files. While Sapling doesn’t completely solve this, it improves the user experience by supporting calling code generators to solve rebase conflicts. This allows conflicts in generated code to be handled at rebase time and allows code-pushing automation to automatically regenerate code on the users behalf when it encounters a push failure due to a conflict.

Operations that require all files or all commits (O(files) or O(commits)) space or time complexities are gradually no longer affordable. Push throughput could also be an issue.

The server can utilize distributed storage and pre-build various kinds of indexes to provide more efficient operations. While Sapling is less &quot;distributed&quot;, we tried to make the difference transparent to the user. For example, our lazy commit graph implementation does not require extra commands to &quot;deepen&quot; the graph. The user sees full history. That said, we do drop support of pulling from a lazy repo. Commit cloud covers these use-cases.

To stay on top of this, the Sapling team developed tools to make it easier to debug engineer issues quickly. Note, some of these are not available by default in the open source release since they require logging and services that only make sense within an organization. sl doctor is a command that attempts to fix a number of known issues, such as repository corruption. As new issues are found, sl doctor is updated to fix them, which allows engineers to self-remediate many issues, thereby helping reduce the support burden on the Sapling team.sl rage is a command that gathers state about the engineer’s source control environment and creates a human readable text file with the information. It contains hostname, filesystem, disk usage, smartlog/status output, configuration, and recent commands, logs, errors, and profiles. This information allows the engineer to provide us with all the data we need without having to have a bunch of back and forths. The version of Sapling used inside Meta automatically uploads the rage file to a server for easy viewing by the Sapling team. The open source version does not upload any data.If an engineer complains about a slow command, adding --profile to any command allows them to produce a profile in the output. This makes it easy for the Sapling team to identify where the problem is, without having access to their machine or walking the engineer through how to use a profiler. If a command is hung, a similar traceback is written to .sl/sigtraces/ every 60 seconds, allowing us to see exactly where the current process is stuck. These tools make debugging tricky performance issues much easier, especially in a distributed environment. ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Managing configuration​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Organizational scale","url":"/docs/scale/organizational#managing-configuration","content":"Configuration is a critical part of the Sapling experience at Meta and plays a large part in how we roll out new features. In the past we used a hierarchy of configuration files (similar to a /etc/gitconfig which recursively includes other config files) which were written by various systems (rpms, Chef, tools, etc). This became unwieldy as the logic that decides which configs are used was distributed across many systems and services, and the order of precedence for the various config files was fragile. To make configuration more scalable, we unified all configuration into an internal dynamic configuration system, cleverly called dynamicconfig. This moved most configuration decisions from across the company into code in a single part of the code base where it could be reasoned about as a cohesive whole. For configs that need to change frequently, like a hotfix remediation or a rollout, we are able to query an internal configuration server for a signed blob of configuration. This remote blob contains a simple JSON decision-tree DSL which the client then executes to determine which configs should be applied to this particular repository. Both the in-code and the remote portions of the configuration allow conditionally enabling configs based on operating system, data center, user, repository, tier, machine shard, user shard, time shard, etc. This allows us to rollout new features to particular machines or users, or to an automatically increasing percentage of users over time. This flexibility has been key to letting Sapling move fast, as we can quickly release or rollback new features, and get feedback in an incremental fashion. Note, this dynamic configuration system is internal to Meta and does not apply to the open source release. No remote configs are downloaded for an open source Sapling build. The code for dynamicconfig is not currently visible in the repository as it contains internal configuration information. If external groups are interested in similar capabilities we could potentially make the capability public.

Distributed source control repositories are particularly difficult structures to change because: The contents are recursively hashed and the hashes are highly intertwined. Changing one byte changes every hash in the repository from there on.The data is widely distributed so a migration has to happen on many machines and there is no single source of truth. This makes incremental migrations hard, since changing anything in the repository affects all the hashes and since everyone’s individual copy of the repo will need to be migrated. Within Meta, these migrations fell into two categories: repository merges and format migrations. Repository Merges Accomplishing repository merges involving thousands of people deserves a blog post of its own. At a high level though, we developed server-side capabilities that let us “bind” directories in two repositories together so that any change to one was atomically applied to the other repository as well. These bindings could be done either for the whole repository, or for individual directories in a repository. This allowed us to make the contents of one repo available in another repo without any users having to immediately migrate. With the source control portion of the migration done transparently, the migration of users and tools could be done incrementally and in a way that was easy to rollback from. Once all users and tools had migrated, we could shut down the old repository and remove the bindings. Format Migrations Changing the hash scheme of the repository or the on-disk storage formats was particularly tricky since it meant migrating every single repository on every single machine for every single engineer. These migrations generally required writing to both the new and the old format for a while, often auditing that the results were equivalent, before turning off the old format. This required strong metrics (see below) to guarantee that the change had rolled out widely enough and taken effect on almost all the machines. It also required strong guarantees about the ability to roll new versions of the Sapling package to all machines. Internally we deploy new Sapling packages on a continuous basis, and prevent the execution of packages that are too old. Hash scheme changes, while rare, required the additional step of maintaining a mapping between the new and the old hash scheme, and being able to validate past hashes which still used the old scheme. ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Metrics and logging​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Organizational scale","url":"/docs/scale/organizational#metrics-and-logging","content":"Having real-time metrics on source control commands is critical for maintaining and improving the source control experience within Meta. Internally, we upload a wide variety of metrics for every Sapling command that is run, from command duration, to time waiting on other services, to number of files changed, network throughput, error traces, and more. This lets us not only keep an eye on long-term performance and reliability trends, but enables us to see the impact of current rollouts on performance and catch regressions before they affect everyone. The metrics are also useful for debugging individual developer issues. If an engineer comes to us saying a given command failed yesterday, we’re able to look at the log and see exactly what Sapling commands ran around that time, where the commands spent their time, and how they exited. By combining the logs with Commit Cloud, the internal service that backs up every commit as it is made, we’re often able to reproduce the exact situation the engineer experienced, without needing further information from the engineer. Note, none of this applies to the open source release. Neither metrics nor commits are uploaded from the open source Sapling builds. These logging and metrics tools are strictly internal to Meta.
