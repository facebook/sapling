To merge files Mercurial uses merge tools.

A merge tool combines two different versions of a file into a merged
file. Merge tools are given the two files and the greatest common
ancestor of the two file versions, so they can determine the changes
made on both branches.

The merge tools are used both for :hg:`resolve` and :hg:`merge`.

Usually, the merge tool tries to automatically, by combining all the
non-overlapping changes that occurred separately in the two different
evolutions of the same initial base file. Furthermore, some
interactive merge programs make it easier to manually resolve
conflicting merges, either in a graphical way, or by inserting some
conflict markers. Mercurial does not include any interactive merge
programs but relies on external tools for that. External merge tools
and their properties and usage is configured in merge-tools section -
see hgrc(5).

There are a some internal merge tools which can be used. The internal
merge tools are:

``internal:merge``
   Uses the internal non-interactive merge tool for merging files.

``internal:fail``
   Rather than attempting to merge files that were modified on both
   branches, it marks these files as unresolved. Then the resolve
   command must be used to mark files resolved.

``internal:local``
   Uses the local version of files as the merged version.

``internal:other``
   Uses the remote version of files as the merged version.

``internal:prompt``
   Asks the user which of the local or the other version to keep as
   the merged version.

``internal:dump``
   Creates three versions of the files to merge, containing the
   contents of local, other and base. These files can then be used to
   perform a merge manually. If the file merged is name ``a.txt``,
   these files will accordingly be named ``a.txt.local``,
   ``a.txt.other`` and ``a.txt.base`` and they will be placed in the
   same directory as the file to merge.

How Mercurial decides which merge program to use

1. If the ``HGMERGE`` environment variable is present, it is used. If
   specified it must be either an executable path or the name of an
   application in your executable search path.

2. If the filename of the file to be merged matches any of the
   patterns in the merge-patterns configuration section, then the
   corresponding merge tool is used, unless the file to be merged is a
   symlink. Here binary capabilities of the merge tool are not
   considered.

3. If ui.merge is set, it is used.

4. If any merge tools are present in the merge-tools configuration
   section, and any of the tools can be found on the system, the
   priority settings are used to determine which one to use. Binary,
   symlink and GUI capabilities do also have to match.

5. If a program named ``hgmerge`` exists on the system, it is used.

6. If the file to be merged is not binary and is not a symlink, then
   ``internal:merge`` is used.

7. The merge fails.

.. note::
   After selecting a merge program, Mercurial will by default attempt
   to merge the files using a simple merge algorithm first, to see if
   they can be merged without conflicts. Only if there are conflicting
   changes Mercurial will actually execute the merge program. Whether
   to use the simple merge algorithm first can be controlled be the
   premerge setting of the merge tool, which is enabled by default
   unless the file is binary or symlink.

See the merge-tools and ui sections of hgrc(5) for details on
configuration of merge tools.
