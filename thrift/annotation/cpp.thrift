 * Changes the native type of a Thrift object (the C++ type used in codegen) to the value of the `name` field.

 * (e.g. `template = "folly::sorted_vector_set"` is equivalent to `type = "folly::sorted_vector_set<T>"` on `set<T>`)
 *
 * It is also possible to add `cpp_include` to bring in additional data structures and use them here.
 * It is required that the custom type matches the specified Thrift type even for internal container types.
 * Prefer types that can leverage `reserve(size_t)` as Thrift makes uses these optimizations.
 * *Special Case*: This annotation can be used to define a string/binary type as `IOBuf` or `unique_ptr<IOBuf>` so that you can leverage Thrift's support for zero-copy buffer manipulation through `IOBuf`.
 * During deserialization, thrift receives a buffer that is used to allocate the appropriate fields in the struct. When using smart pointers, instead of making a copy of the data, it only modifies the pointer to point to the address that is used by the buffer.
 *
 * The custom type must provide the following methods
 * * `list`: `push_back(T)`
 * * `map`: `insert(std::pair<T1, T2>)`
 * * `set`: `insert(T)`
