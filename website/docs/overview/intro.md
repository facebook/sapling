# Intro

This overview highlights a few of the interesting areas of Sapling's
user experience. It is by no means exhaustive (quite the opposite, really), nor
is it meant to be a complete how-to guide for using Sapling. Rather, it is aimed
at people who are already familiar with using distributed version control
systems such as Git and are curious about how Sapling handles common workflows
and how it might differ from what you are used to.

Topics will be added as areas of interest are brought to our attention.
