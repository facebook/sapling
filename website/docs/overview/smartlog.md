# Smartlog

Forming a mental picture of a repository is one of the largest hurdles for users learning distributed version control. A poor mental model leads to people not understanding what commands actually do, not understanding how to recover from mistakes, not being able to use advanced features, and generally leads to people copy/pasting commands they’ve memorized and then recloning when things go awry.

Instead of requiring users to piece together the state of their repo via `log`, `branch`, etc, we built Smartlog and made it the centerpiece of Sapling’s user experience. As such, `sl smartlog` is one of the most important commands in Sapling as it lets you see the state of your local repo clearly and concisely, without having to learn multiple commands or maintain a complex mental model of the repository.

It shows you:

- Your not-yet-pushed commits.
- The location of main, and other important branches (configurable).
- The graph relationship between these commits.
- Where you are (`@`).
- Which commits are old and have been landed, rebased, amended, etc. See the ‘x’ commit, with the "Landed as YYY" message.
- Important details for each commit: short hash, date, author, local and remote bookmarks, and title. It can be configured to show other information from inside the commit as well, such as task number or pull request number.

Smartlog provides you with a succinct view of your work by hiding all commits that aren’t relevant to you. In the example below, the dashed line on the left represents the main branch and elides thousands of commits to show you just the ones relevant to you.

Smartlog can be displayed via `sl smartlog` or by just running `sl`.

### Interactive GUI smartlog

An interactive smartlog GUI is available by running `sl web`. This shows similar information to `sl smartlog` while also refreshing automatically, and allows you to run commands or drag and drop commits to rebase them.
