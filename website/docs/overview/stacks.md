# Stacks of commits

Sapling provides first-class support for editing and manipulating stacks of commits.

### Amend

You can edit any commit in your stack by going to that commit (via <Command name="goto" />), making the desired modifications, and then running <Command name="amend" /> to edit the commit. Keep in mind that if you make a mistake, you can always [Undo](undo.md) your changes!


```sl-shell-example
$ sl
  o  d9a5aa3c7  3 seconds ago  mary
  │  feature two
  │
  @  8a644a0fd  30 seconds ago  mary
╭─╯  feature one
│
o  ea609e1ef  7 minutes ago  remote/main
╷
~

$ echo "Add feature to myproject" >> myproject.cpp

# Apply changes to the current commit
$ sl amend
$ sl show .

diff --git a/myproject.cpp b/myproject.cpp
new file mode 100644
--- /dev/null
+++ b/myproject.cpp

+<amended feature one impl>

```

### Fold

If you have a stack of commits, you can fold commits down into a single commit with the <Command name="fold" /> command. You can either specify `--from <commit id>` to specify a range of commits from your current commit to fold together or specify `--exact <list of commit ids>` to specify exact adjacent commits to fold together.

```sl-shell-example
$ sl
  o 5dbd8043f 82 seconds ago mary
  │ commit five
  │
  @ bd057eb7f 93 seconds ago mary
  │ commit four
  │
  o b65a4efb1 113 seconds ago mary
  │ commit three

  │
  o 398748c95 10 minutes ago mary
╭─╯ commit one
│
o ea609e1ef Today at 14:34 remote/main
```


### Split

Use Sapling’s interactive editor interface to split the changes in one commit into two or more smaller commits.


```sl-shell-example
$ sl
  @ b86c5cb40 2 seconds ago mary
╭─╯ feature one + two
│
o ea609e1ef Today at 14:34 remote/main

# we want to split apart feature one and feature two
$ sl split

 # <press c>

# remaining unselected changes go into second commit
# <enter new commit message for second commit>

$ sl

  │ feature two
  │
  o 619efe410 2 minutes ago mary
╭─╯ feature one
│
o ea609e1ef Today at 14:34 remote/main
```

### Absorb

If you make changes while working at the top of a stack, the <Command name="absorb" /> command allows you to automatically amend those changes to commits lower in the stack. If there is an unambiguous commit which introduced the edited lines, the absorb command will prompt to apply those changes to that commit.

```sl-shell-example
$ sl
  @ a305c853a 41 seconds ago mary
  │ feature two
  │
  o 619efe410 2 minutes ago mary
╭─╯ feature one

```

### Amend --to
Sometimes absorb cannot predict an appropriate commit to apply changes to. In this case you can try the command `sl amend --to` to specify exactly which commit to apply pending changes to.

```sl-shell-example
$ sl
  @  f656ac8c6  30 minutes ago  mary
  │  feature two
  │
  o  cbf60a27c  30 minutes ago  mary
