**check out an ancestor commit**

Update to an ancestor commit of the current commit. When working with a stack
of commits, you can use `sl previous` to move down your stack with ease.

- Use the `--newest` flag to always pick the newest of multiple parents commits.  You can set `amend.alwaysnewest` to true in your global Sapling config file to make  this the default.

- Use the `--merge` flag to bring along uncommitted changes to the destination  commit.

- Use the `--bookmark` flag to move to the first ancestor commit with a bookmark.

Examples:

- Move 1 level down the stack:

```
sl prev
```

- Move 2 levels down the stack:

```
sl prev 2
```

- Move to the bottom of the stack:

```
sl prev --bottom
```
