/// This type is a token that allows code to prove initFacebook has been called.
/// A function can require this proof by taking `_fb: FacebookInit` as an
/// argument.
///
/// The basic assumption of initFacebook is that it happens at the very
/// beginning of main before there are additional threads. It must be allowed to
/// modify process-global state like env vars or gflags without the risk of
/// undefined behavior from other code concurrently reading those things.
///
/// The preferred way to obtain a proof token is through a pair of attribute
/// macros exported by this crate. `#[fbinit::main]` is placed on your main
/// function and will call initFacebook and provide the resulting proof:
///
///     #[fbinit::main]
///     fn main(fb: fbinit::FacebookInit) {
///         /* ... */
///     }
///
/// The proof argument is optional. If you don't need it, this is fine too:
///
///     #[fbinit::main]
///     fn main() {
///         /* ... */
///     }
///
/// If main is async, the attribute behaves like `#\[tokio::main\].
///
///     #[fbinit::main]
///     async fn main(fb: fbinit::FacebookInit) {
///         yay().await;
///     }
///
///     async fn yay() {}
///
/// There is also `#\[fbinit::test\]` which behaves like `#\[test\]` or
/// `#\[tokio::test\]`.
///
///     #[fbinit::test]
///     fn test_my_service(fb: fbinit::FacebookInit) {
///         /* ... */
///     }
///
///     #[fbinit::test]
///     async fn async_test(fb: fbinit::FacebookInit) {
///         /* ... */
