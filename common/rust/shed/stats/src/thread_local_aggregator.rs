//! This module provides the means to define stats that are thread local and to
//! schedule a periodic aggregation process of those stats.
//!
//! The assumption behind this library is that there are much more writes to the
//! stats than there are reads. Because of that it's vital that writes are quick
//! while reads can be a little relaxed, so that recent writes might not be
//! visible in the read until an aggregation is called.
//!
//! Thread local stats help with the speed goal of writes - except for
//! infrequent reads no one is racing with the current thread to access those
//! values. As for periodic aggregation - this is achieved via a future running
//! every second thanks to tokio timer and aggregating every thread local stat.
//! The future must be spawned on tokio in order for the aggregation to work.
