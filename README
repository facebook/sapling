hgsubversion is an extension for Mercurial that allows using Mercurial as a 
Subversion client.

Right now it is *not* ready for production use. You should only be using this if 
you're ready to hack on it, and go diving into the internals of Mercurial and/or 
Subversion.

== Basic Use ==
Get a new clone of an svn server:
$ hg svnclone <svn URI> [destination]
Real example:
hg svnclone http://python-nose.googlecode.com/svn nose-hg

Pull new revisions into an already-converted repo:
$ hg svn pull

For more information, see 'hg svn help' while in a converted repo.
