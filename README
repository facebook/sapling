MERCURIAL QUICK-START

Setting up Mercurial:

 Note: some distributions fails to include bits of distutils by
 default, you'll need python-dev to install. You'll also need a C
 compiler and a 3-way merge tool like merge, tkdiff, or kdiff3.

 First, unpack the source:

 $ tar xvzf mercurial-<ver>.tar.gz
 $ cd mercurial-<ver>

 To install system-wide:

 $ python setup.py install   # change python to python2.3 if 2.2 is default

 To install in your home directory (~/bin and ~/lib, actually), run:

 $ python2.3 setup.py install --home=~
 $ export PYTHONPATH=${HOME}/lib/python  # add this to your .bashrc
 $ export PATH=${HOME}/bin:$PATH         # 

 And finally:

 $ hg                                    # test installation, show help

 If you get complaints about missing modules, you probably haven't set
 PYTHONPATH correctly.

Setting up a Mercurial project:

 $ cd project/
 $ hg init         # creates .hg
 $ hg status       # show changes between repo and working dir
 $ hg diff         # generate a unidiff
 $ hg addremove    # add all unknown files and remove all missing files
 $ hg commit       # commit all changes, edit changelog entry
 $ hg export <rev> # export a changeset as a diff

 Mercurial will look for a file named .hgignore in the root of your
 repository contains a set of regular expressions to ignore in file
 paths.

Mercurial commands:

 $ hg help [command]   # get online help
 $ hg history          # show changesets
 $ hg log Makefile     # show commits per file
 $ hg update           # check out the tip revision
 $ hg update <id>      # check out a specified changeset
                       # IDs can be tags, revision numbers, or unique
                       # subsets of changeset hash numbers
 $ hg add foo          # add a new file for the next commit
 $ hg remove bar       # mark a file as removed
 $ hg verify           # check repo integrity
 $ hg tags             # show current tags
 $ hg annotate [files] # show changeset numbers for each file line

Branching and merging:

 $ cd ..
 $ mkdir linux-work
 $ cd linux-work
 $ hg init ../linux          # create a new branch
 $ hg update                 # populate the working directory
 $ <make changes>
 $ hg commit
 $ cd ../linux
 $ hg pull ../linux-work     # pull changesets from linux-work
 $ hg update -m              # merge the new tip from linux-work into
                             # our working directory

Importing patches:

 Fast:
 $ patch < ../p/foo.patch
 $ hg addremove
 $ hg commit

 Faster:
 $ patch < ../p/foo.patch
 $ hg commit `lsdiff -p1 ../p/foo.patch`

 Fastest:
 $ cat ../p/patchlist | xargs hg import -p1 -b ../p 

Exporting a patch:

 (make changes)
 $ hg commit
 $ hg tip
 28237:747a537bd090880c29eae861df4d81b245aa0190
 $ hg export 28237 > foo.patch    # export changeset 28237

Network support:

 # pull from the primary Mercurial repo
 foo$ hg init
 foo$ hg pull http://selenic.com/hg/
 foo$ hg update # hg co works too

 # export your current repo via HTTP with browsable interface
 foo$ hg serve -n "My repo" -p 80
 
 # pushing changes to a remote repo with SSH
 foo$ hg push ssh://user@example.com/~/hg/

 # merge changes from a remote machine
 bar$ hg pull http://foo/
 bar$ hg update -m        # merge changes into your working directory

 # Set up a CGI server on your webserver
 foo$ cp hgweb.cgi ~/public_html/hg/index.cgi
 foo$ emacs ~/public_html/hg/index.cgi # adjust the defaults

Symbolic repository names:

 Mercurial uses an options file called ~/.hgrc. To track locations
 symbolically, add a section to it like this:

 [paths]
 main = http://selenic.com/hg
 linux = http://www.kernel.org/hg/
