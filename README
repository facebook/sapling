Keep track of remote branch heads in Mercurial.

With this extension installed, Mercurial gains one new feature: when
you pull from a repository listed in .hg/hgrc's ``[paths]`` section,
you get output similar to the following::

 @  3[tip]   7c2fd3b9020c   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
 |    Add delta
 |
 o  2[default/default]   030b686bedc4   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
 |    Add gamma
 |
 o  1[stable/default]   c561b4e977df   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
 |    Add beta
 |
 o  0   d8d2fcd0e319   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
      Add alpha

What this output is showing is that the head of the default branch in
a repo at path ``stable`` is ``c561b4e977df``, and the head of default
in the repo at path ``default`` is at ``030b686bedc4``. This is
accomplished by sending a single extra request to the Mercurial server
after the pull is complete.  The nature of this request (branchheads)
requires that the server be Mercurial 1.3 or newer.

This extension should work properly with paths from the schemes extension
included with Mercurial 1.4 and later. Other extensions which perform varying
kinds of manipulation on the repository path may not function as expected.

When revsets are available (Mercurial 1.7 and later), remotebranches
makes two new revsets available: ``pushed()`` and ``upstream()``. The
``pushed()`` revset returns all revisions that are have been pushed to
any repository tracked by remotebranches. The ``upstream()`` set is
those revisions which are in a repository whose path is listed in the
``upstream`` field of the ``[remotebranches]`` configuration
section. If there is no ``remotebranches.upstream`` setting, it
defaults to behaving identically to ``pushed()``.
