About
-----
hgsubversion is an extension for Mercurial that allows using Mercurial as a 
Subversion client.

Right now it is *not* ready for production use. You should only be using this if 
you're ready to hack on it, and go diving into the internals of Mercurial and/or 
Subversion.

Installation
------------
You need to have Subversion installed with the SWIG Python bindings from Subversion 1.5 or later.
You need a recent Mercurial. At present, the required memctx code is in mercurial_, crew_, and crew-stable_, but not mercurial-stable. Install Mercurial from one of mercurial or the crew repos if you have not already. Personally, I use crew_.

If you are unfamiliar with installing Mercurial extensions, please see the UsingExtensions_ page in the Mercurial wiki. Look at the example for specifying an absolute path near the bottom of the page. You want to give the path to the top level of your clone of this repository.

Before using hgsubversion, I *strongly* encourage you to run the automated tests. Just use nose_ if you have it (or ``easy_install nose`` if you want it), or use ``python tests/run.py`` to run the suite with the conventional test runner. Note that because I use nose, there's a lot of stdout spew in the tests right now. The important part is that all the tests pass.

Basic Use
-----------
Get a new clone of an svn server::

 $ hg svnclone <svn URI> [destination]

Real example::

 $ hg svnclone http://python-nose.googlecode.com/svn nose-hg

Pull new revisions into an already-converted repo::

 $ hg svn pull

For more information, see 'hg svn help' while in a converted repo.
