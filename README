What is "hg purge"?
===================
"purge" is a simple extension for the Mercurial source control management
system (http://www.selenic.com/mercurial).
This extension adds a "purge" command to "hg" that removes files not known
to mercurial, this is useful to test local and uncommitted changes in the
otherwise clean source tree.

This means that Mercurial will delete:
 - Unknown files: files marked with "?" by "hg status"
 - Ignored files: files usually ignored by Mercurial because they match a
   pattern in a ".hgignore" file
 - Empty directories: infact Mercurial ignores directories unless they
   contain files under source control managment
But it will leave untouched:
 - Unmodified files tracked by Mercurial
 - Modified files tracked by Mercurial
 - New files added to the repository (with "hg add")

Be careful with "hg purge", you could irreversibly delete some files you
forgot to add to the repository. If you only want to print the list of
files that this program would delete use:
  hg purge -vn


How to install
==============
Put the "purge.py" file in a directory of your choice, then enable the
extension putting a line like:
  purge=/path/you/choose/purge.py
in the "[extensions]" section of a configuration file read by "hg". For
more information on these files read the man page for "hgrc":
  man 5 hgrc


How to use "hg purge"
====================
For help on the usage of "hg purge" use:
  hg help purge
