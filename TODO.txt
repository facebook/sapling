GENERAL
==========
* fully integrate as native protocol handler (see hgsubversion)
  - hg push git@...
  - hg fetch [remote] (remote is url, hg alias or hg-git remote)
  - hg clone url

* work fine with eclipse plugin or tortoise-hg

MAPPING ISSUES
==============
* work in Git on a named branch created in Hg is forward-ported to be named branch commits in Hg and stripped back out if re-exported
* timezone issues (?)


REMOTE/BRANCH STUFF
=====================
* push with branch names (w/ proper error messages)
* explain what branch mapping policy determined when updating refs

* add a warning for a non-fast forward push
* error nicer if pushing to remote without push access (over git://)
* fail nicely when the remote_name is not there


WEBSITE
===========
* more usage documentation
* screencast


SPEED/EFFICIENCY
================
* switch object mapping to hg->git since the many to one is that direction
* don't send blobs/trees already on server (thin pack)
* packfile creation benchmarking (seems to take a while sometimes)
  - at least provide status output


MAYBE
==========
* submodules?
* .gitignore, etc - try to convert? 
  - (probably not automatically, but perhaps a generator?)
