CLONE
===========

* only try to import non-mapped commits
* checkout the HEAD 
* limit to HEAD branch? (gh-pages makes weird import)
  - possibly also add bookmarks on the same development line

* strip or close branches that have been abandoned (?)

* tag conversion

FETCH
===========

* gfetch command
* some sort of remote management

PUSH
==========

* get a list of all the hg changesets not yet mapped
* create git objects from each changeset (incl trees/blobs)
  - add metadata to commits (branch names, explicit file names)
* update mapfile with new changeset/commit mapping
* connect to server pushing to
  - figure out needs (use heads/bookmarks for haves)
* create packfile with needed objects
  - some delta compression if possible (?)
* upload packfile, remove temp packfile

* convert tags to git
