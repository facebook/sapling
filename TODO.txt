GENERAL
==========
* respect file modes on conversions
* explicit file renames
* integrate as native protocol handler (hg push git://...)
* more tests
* submodules?
* .gitignore, etc - try to convert? 
  - (probably not automatically, but perhaps a generator?)

PUSH
==========
* push with branch names (w/ proper error messages)
* explain what branch mapping policy determined when updating refs
* convert tags to git
* octopus merge explode re-implode

FETCH
===========
* gfetch command
* only try to import non-mapped commits
* tag conversion
* save git metadata (committers, unless it's the same) as extra info
* octopus merge explode

SPEED/EFFICIENCY
================
* switch object mapping to hg->git since the many to one is that direction
* don't send blobs/trees already on server

MILESTONES
=============
* Hg<->Git<->Hg
  - create a repo in Hg
  - push to a Git server
  - clone into another Hg client
  - verify that the node ids are identical
