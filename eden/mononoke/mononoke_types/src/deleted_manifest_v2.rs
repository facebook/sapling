/// Deleted Manifest is a data structure that tracks deleted files and commits where they
/// were deleted. This manifest was designed in addition to Unodes to make following file history
/// across deletions possible.
///
/// Both directories and files are represented by the same data structure, which consists of:
/// * optional<linknode>: if set, a changeset where this path was deleted
/// * subentries: a map from base name to the deleted manifest for this path
/// Even though the manifest tracks only deleted paths, it will still have entries for the
/// existing directories where files were deleted. Optional field `linknode` indicates whether the
/// path still exists (not set) or it was deleted.
///
/// Q&A
///
/// Why the manifest has same data structure for files and directories?
///
/// Deleted manifest doesn't differ files from directories, because any file path can be
/// reincarnated after the deletion as a directory and vice versa. The manifest doesn't need
/// to know whether the path is a directory or a file, the only important information is "if the
/// path was deleted, which changeset did it?"
///
/// Why we don't keep a path_hash even though it provides uniqueness of entries?
///
/// The deleted manifest entry doesn't have a path_hash, that means the entries are identical
/// for different files deleted in the same commit. This is fine as soon as we don't care about the
/// the uniqueness, but about the fact that the files were deleted. So directory entry will have
/// links to the same entry for different deleted files.
/// However, if one of such files is recreated as a directory, we anyway create a new entry for it:
/// manifest entries are immutable.
///
/// How we derive deleted manifest?
///
/// Assuming we have a computed deleted manifests for all the current commits, for a new
/// changeset:
/// 1. For each deleted file create a new manifest entry with a linknode to the changeset, where
/// file was deleted.
/// 2. For each recreated file remove this file from the manifest.
/// 3. Remove directory manifest if it still exists and don’t have deleted children anymore.
/// 4. Create new manifest nodes recursively.
/// 5. Finalize the conversion by recording the mapping from changeset id to the root deleted
/// files manifest hash.
///
/// Where does point a linknode for a file that was markes as deleted in a merge commit?
///
/// Linknode will point to the merge commit itself, if the file deletion was made in some of the
/// parents and was accepted in merge commit.
///
/// How do we perform tracking file history across deletions?
///
/// Assume we have a commit graph, where:
/// * - file was deleted
/// o - file exists
///
///   o A
///   |
///   * B
///  / \
/// *   * C
/// |   |
/// : D o E
/// |   |
/// o F :
///
/// 1. Check deleted manifest from node B: the file was deleted with linknode to B.
/// 2. Need to consider all ancestors of B:
///    * check unodes for the parents: if the file exists,
///        traverse the history
///    * if not, check the deleted manifest whether the file
///        existed and was deleted
