Create two base files
  $ hg up -q "min(all())"
  $ cat > multi_a.txt << 'EOF'
  > aaa_line1
  > aaa_line2
  > aaa_line3
  > EOF
  $ cat > multi_b.txt << 'EOF'
  > bbb_line1
  > bbb_line2
  > bbb_line3
  > EOF
  $ hg add multi_a.txt multi_b.txt
  $ hg ci -m "add multi files"
  $ hg push -r . --to master_bookmark -q

Server edits first line of both files
  $ hg up -q master_bookmark
  $ cat > multi_a.txt << 'EOF'
  > SERVER_aaa_line1
  > aaa_line2
  > aaa_line3
  > EOF
  $ cat > multi_b.txt << 'EOF'
  > SERVER_bbb_line1
  > bbb_line2
  > bbb_line3
  > EOF
  $ hg ci -m "server: edit first lines"
  $ hg push -r . --to master_bookmark -q

Client edits last line of both files (from pre-server base)
  $ hg up -q .~1
  $ cat > multi_a.txt << 'EOF'
  > aaa_line1
  > aaa_line2
  > CLIENT_aaa_line3
  > EOF
  $ cat > multi_b.txt << 'EOF'
  > bbb_line1
  > bbb_line2
  > CLIENT_bbb_line3
  > EOF
  $ hg ci -m "client: edit last lines"

Pushrebase should succeed — both files merge cleanly
  $ hg push -r . --to master_bookmark

Verify both files have merged content
  $ hg up -q master_bookmark

  $ cat multi_b.txt
