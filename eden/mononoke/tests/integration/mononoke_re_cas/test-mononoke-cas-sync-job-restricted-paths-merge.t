A merge takes a restricted directory from its second parent. The directory is
unchanged relative to p2, so it is absent from the merge's bonsai file changes,
yet the sync diffs against p1 -- which never had it -- so the restricted tree is
in the upload set and must still be filtered out of it.

  $ . "${TEST_FIXTURES}/library.sh"
  $ setup_common_config
  $ export CAS_STORE_PATH="$TESTTMP"
  $ setconfig drawdag.defaultfiles=false

Configure restricted paths: "restricted" directory is restricted.
  $ cd "$TESTTMP/mononoke-config"
  $ cat >> repos/repo/server.toml <<EOF
  > [restricted_paths_config]
  > path_restriction_metadata = { "restricted" = { repo_region_acl = "SERVICE_IDENTITY:restricted_acl" } }
  > [restricted_paths_config.manifest_id_store_config]
  > use_manifest_id_cache = false
  > cache_update_interval_ms = 1000
  > EOF

  $ start_and_wait_for_mononoke_server
  $ hg clone -q mono:repo repo
  $ cd repo

Only C touches the restricted directory. M merges C into B and changes nothing
of its own.
  $ drawdag --parent-order=name << 'EOF'
  > M          # B/feature = random:30
  > |\         # C/restricted/secret = random:30
  > B C        # A/public/readme = random:30
  > |/
  > A
  > EOF

B is p1 and C is p2. The whole test depends on this: the restricted directory
must arrive from the parent the sync does NOT diff against.
  $ hg log -r "p1($M)" -T "{node}" | grep $B > /dev/null
  $ hg log -r "p2($M)" -T "{node}" | grep $C > /dev/null

  $ hg push -r $A --to master_bookmark -q --create
  $ hg push -r $M --to master_bookmark -q

The bookmark move A -> M expands to [B, C, M], so one run covers both the linear
case and the merge case. Both C and M are filtered, for 9 digests: A's root,
public and public/readme; B's root and feature; C's root and restricted/secret;
and M's root and restricted/secret. Neither C's nor M's restricted tree is
uploaded, and they are the same tree -- an unchanged directory reuses its
parent's node.
