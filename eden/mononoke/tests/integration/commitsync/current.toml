# Common definition for commit sync path mapping
#
# A top-level config must have a name and a repo-id of a large repo
# It may have multiple subconfigs, named `<top-level-name>.small_repos`
# Each of the the `small_repos` configs MUST have:
# - a repo id
# - a bookmark prefix to prepend to every bookmark name
# - a default path syncing action. Is used when none of the
#   "map" values matches a path. Can be one of:
#   - "preserve": keep this path as it is when syncing
#   - "prepend_prefix": prepend the "default_prefix" to this path
#      when syncing
# Each of the `small_repos` configs MAY have:
# - a map of prefixes to new prefixes, key "map"
#
# Note: config is written from the "bottom-up" perspective, e.g.
#       it contains mappings, needed to sync small repos into a
#       a large repo. This mapping needs to be reversible
#       (and is reversed when the sync happens in a large-to-small
#       direction)
