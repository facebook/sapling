//! Level-triggered config-reload reconciliation controller for Mononoke — the
//! control plane for *"which repos/config should this task serve, right now?"*.
//!
//! [`reconcile`] diffs the controller's per-repo state against the live desired
//! config and converges: build new shallow members, rebuild on real content
//! drift (deep in place), drop only on positive evidence, and retry failures —
//! idempotently, so correctness depends only on *"a reconcile eventually runs"*,
//! never on which event fired in what order.
//!
//! The crate is deliberately decoupled from Mononoke's config/repo internals:
//! callers implement [`ConfigSource`] and [`RepoManager`]. That keeps this crate
//! free of config-store, repo-factory, JustKnobs, and stats dependencies, and
//! makes the whole control loop unit-testable with in-memory fakes.
