/**
 * An ImmediateFuture is a Future type with similar semantics to folly::Future
 * except that it optimizes the already-fulfilled case by storing a Try<T>
 * inline. This allows code to not pay the allocation and atomic refcounting
 * overhead of folly::SemiFuture when an immediate value is available.
 *
 * Unlike Future and like SemiFuture, ImmediateFuture will never run an attached
 * callback on the thread that fulfills the corresponding Promise.
 *
 * Like Future and unlike SemiFuture, callbacks must handle running immediately.
 * An attached callback may run either immediately or later, when the
 * ImmediateFuture's value is consumed.
 *
 * All methods can throw an DestroyedImmediateFutureError if an ImmediateFuture
 * is used after being destroyed. This can happen if an ImmediateFuture is used
 * after being moved.
 *
 * When detail::kImmediateFutureAlwaysDefer is set, all ImmediateFuture
 * constructor are pessimized to behave as if constructed from a non-ready
 * SemiFuture.
