# Futures and Asynchronous Code

This document assumes some working knowledge of folly::Future and
folly::SemiFuture. Please read the
[Future overview](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/docs/Futures.md)
first.

## Why Future?

EdenFS is largely concurrent and asynchronous. The traditional way to write this
kind of code would be explicit state machines with requests and callbacks. It's
easy to forget to call a callback or call one twice under rarely-executed paths
like error handling.

To make asynchronous code easier to reason about, Folly provides `folly::Future`
and `folly::Promise`. Each Future and Promise form a pair, where `folly::Future`
holds the eventual value and Promise is how the value is published. Readers can
either block on the result (offering their thread to any callbacks that may run)
or schedule a callback to be run when the value is available. `folly::Promise`
is fulfilled on the writing side.

## Why SemiFuture?

The biggest problem with Future is that callbacks may run either on the thread
calling `Future::then` or on the thread calling `Promise::set`. Callbacks have
to be written carefully, and if they acquire locks, any site that calls
`Future::then` or `Promise::set` must not hold those locks.

`folly::SemiFuture` is a reaction to these problems. It's a Future without a
`SemiFuture::then` method. Assuming no use of unsafe APIs (including any
`InlineExecutor`), callbacks will never run on the thread that calls
`Promise::set`. Any system with an internal thread pool that cannot tolerate
arbitrary callbacks running on its threads should use `SemiFuture`.

## Why ImmediateFuture?

`folly::Future` and `folly::SemiFuture` introduce significant overhead. A
`Future`/`Promise` pair hold a heap-allocated, atomic refcounted `FutureCore`.
In EdenFS, it's common to make an asynchronous call that hits cache and can
answer immediately. Heap allocating the result is comparatively expensive. We
introduced `facebook::eden::ImmediateFuture` for those cases. ImmediateFuture
either stores the result value inline or holds a SemiFuture.

## When should I use which Future?

There are reasons to use each Future.

`folly::Future` should be used when it's important the callback runs as early as
possible. For example, measuring the duration of internal operations.

SemiFuture or ImmediateFuture should be used when it's important that chained
callbacks never run on internal thread pools.

ImmediateFuture should be used when the value is small and avoiding an
allocation is important for performance. Large structs can use unique_ptr or
shared_ptr.

It's important to note that, when a callback and its closures hold reference
counts or are larger than the result value, it can be worth using Future,
because the callbacks are collapsed into a value as early as possible.
SemiFuture, even if the SemiFuture is held by an ImmediateFuture, will not
collapse any chained callbacks until the SemiFuture is attached to an executor.

## Safetyness and caveats

### `folly::SemiFuture::via`

The use of `via` is generally safe but more often than not will have surprising
side effects. In particular, `via` acts both on the subsequent continuation, but
also on the previously enqueued `SemiFuture` continuations. That is code like:

```
auto [promise, future] = folly::makePromiseContract<int>();

future
  .deferValue([](int value) {
    return value * 10;
  })
  .via(threadPool)
  .thenValue([](int value) {
    return value / 2;
  });

promise.setValue(42);
```

Will execute both the `deferValue` and the `thenValue` continuation in the
`threadPool`.

In general, any use of `via` outside of entry points (Thrift, FsChannel) should
be discouraged as they can lead to deadlocks with bounded threadpools.

### `folly::InlineLikeExecutor`

As a general rule of thumb, any use of `folly::InlineLikeExecutor` is widely
unsafe and should never be used. This is primarily due to forcing `Promise::set`
to execute the `folly::Future` callbacks in the context of the fulfiller' thread

For instance, if we re-use the previous example, but where the `threadPool` is
an `InlineLikeExecutor` the `setValue` will also execute both continuation
before returning.

This has been known to cause deadlocks in the past. This includes:

- `folly::SemiFuture::toUnsafeFuture` and any `Unsafe` methods as these are
  merely wrappers on `.via(&InlineExecutor::instance())`,
- `folly::Promise::getFuture` for the same reason,
- `folly::SemiFuture::via(&QueuedImmediateExecutor::instance())`

`folly::InlineLikeExecutor` also have the downside to be incompatible with
`folly::coro::Task` which is Folly's coroutine implementation.

### Implicit `folly::Future` execution in the background

Futures attached to executors will continue running even though they are dropped
(implicitly or explicitly). This is leveraged by the inode loading code to
ensure that even in the case of error the future will still execute and update
the loading state machine.

`folly::SemiFuture` on the other hand behave differently as they will never
execute eagerly unless attached to an executor (and thus becoming
`folly::Future). By extension, non-immediate ImmediateFuture behave the same.

## TODO

- Unsafely mapping ImmediateFuture onto Future with
  .via(QueuedImmediateExecutor)?
- What about coroutines?
