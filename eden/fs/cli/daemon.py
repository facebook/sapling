# The amount of time to wait for the edenfs process to exit after we send SIGKILL.
# We normally expect the process to be killed and reaped fairly quickly in this
# situation.  However, in rare cases on very heavily loaded systems it can take a while
# for init/systemd to wait on the process and for everything to be fully cleaned up.
# Therefore we wait up to 30 seconds by default.  (I've seen it take up to a couple
# minutes on systems with extremely high disk I/O load.)

# killing the old process but without starting the new process, which is
# generally undesirable if we can avoid it.
