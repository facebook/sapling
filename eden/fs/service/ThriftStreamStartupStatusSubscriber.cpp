            // apache::thrift::ServerStreamPublisher. In the complete case,
            // startup has finished, so the caller will cleanup the memory for
            // the publisher momentarily. In the cancel case, the memory is
            // not going to be imminently cleaned up. However, when startup
            // finishes the memory will be cleaned up. Trying to remove
            // ourselves from the StartupStatusSubscriberState here is really
            // tricky (need an extra lock, intrusive list, and very careful
            // lock placement to avoid deadlocks). IMO its not worth it to try
            // to clean up the memory rn because startup is short lived.
            //
            // Note the related but second thing we are not doing right now:
            // holding locks. This lambda is called inline with complete and
            // cancel. We hold the StartupStatusSubscriberState lock during
            // complete, so as it stands, it is not safe to try to reaqure the
            // StartupStatusSubscriberState lock here.
            // Its also dangerous to take a lock here that is held during
            // createPublisher because you would be relying on createPublisher
            // not calling cancel. I'm pretty sure createPublisher doesn't cal
            // cancel right now, but its a bad idea to rely on the internals
            // of an external library.
