/**
 * InodeMap allows looking up Inode objects based on a inode number.
 *
 * All operations on this class are thread-safe.
 *
 * Note that InodeNumber values and Inode objects have separate lifetimes:
 * - Inode numbers are allocated when we need to return a InodeNumber value to
 *   the FUSE/ProjectedFS APIs. These are generally allocated by lookup()
 *   calls. FUSE will call forget() to let us know when we can forget about a
 *   InodeNumber value. For ProjectedFS, we can forget about an InodeNumber as
 *   soon as it is invalidated from the FS.  (We may not necessarily forget
 *   about the InodeNumber value immediately, though.)
 *
 * - InodeBase objects are needed when we have to actually operate on a file or
 *   directory.  Any operation more than looking up a file name (or some of its
 *   basic attributes that can be found in its parent directory's entry for it)
 *   requires loading its Inode.
 *
 *   After we load an InodeBase object we keep it loaded in memory, since it is
 *   likely to be needed again in the future if the user keeps using the
 *   file/directory.  However, we can unload InodeBase objects on demand when
 *   they are not being used by other parts of the code.  This helps us reduce
 *   our memory footprint.  (For instance, if a user runs a command that walks
 *   the entire repository we don't want to keep Inode objects loaded for all
 *   files forever.)
 *
 * We can unload an InodeBase object even when the InodeNumber value is still
 * valid.  Therefore this class contains two separate maps:
 * - (InodeNumber --> InodeBase)
 *   This map stores all currently loaded Inodes.
 * - (InodeNumber --> (parent InodeNumber, name))
 *   This map contains information about Inodes that are not currently loaded.
 *   This map contains enough information to identify the file or directory in
 *   question if we do need to load the inode.  The parent directory's
 *   InodeNumber may not be loaded either; we have to load it first in order to
 *   load the inode in question.
 *
 * Additional Notes about InodeNumber allocation:
 * - InodeNumber numbers are primarily allocated via the
 *   EdenDispatcher::lookup() call.
 *
 *   Rather than only allocate a InodeNumber in this case, we go ahead and load
 *   the actual TreeInode/FileInode, since FUSE is very likely to make another
 *   call for this inode next.  Therefore, in this case the newly allocated
 *   inode number is inserted directly into loadedInodes_, without ever being
 *   in unloadedInodes_.
 *
 *   The unloadedInodes_ map is primarily for inodes that were loaded and have
 *   since been unloaded due to inactivity.
 *
 * - Inode objects can either be allocated via EdenDispatcher::lookup(), or via
 *   an operation on a TreeInode looking up a child entry.
 *
 *   We currently always allocate a InodeNumber value for any new Inode object
 *   even if it is not needed yet by the FUSE APIs.
