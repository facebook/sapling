   * A few notes about the refcount management:
   *
   * - Inode objects are not necessarily destroyed immediately when the
   *   refcount goes to 0.  They may remain in memory for a while in case they
   *   get used again relatively soon.  When necessary we can sweep the loaded
   *   inode objects and unload inodes whose refcount is 0 and who have not
   *   been accessed recently.
   *
   * - When copying or deleting InodePtr objects this reference count is
   *   updated atomically with acquire/release barriers.  No other locks need
   *   to be held during these operations.  The current thread is guaranteed to
   *   already hold a reference to the Inode in question since it already has
   *   an InodePtr.  These operations can increment a refcount from 1 or more
   *   to a higher value, but they can never increment a refcount from 0 to 1.
   *   They can also decrement a refcount from 1 to 0.
   *
   * - Either the InodeMap lock or the parent TreeInode's contents lock is
   *   always held when incrementing the refcount from 0 to 1.
   *
   *   Only two operations can increment the refcount from 0 to 1:
   *   - InodeMap::lookupInode().
   *     This acquires the InodeMap lock
   *   - TreeInode::getOrLoadChild()
   *     This acquires the parent's TreeInode lock
   *
   *   When checking to see if we can unload an inode, we acquire both it's
   *   parent TreeInode's contents lock and the InodeMap lock (in that order).
   *   We are therefore guaranteed that if the refcount is 0 when we check it,
   *   no other thread can increment it to 1 before we delete the object.
   *
   * Notes about owning vs non-owning pointers:
   * - An Inode always holds an owning TreeInodePtr to its parent.  This
   *   ensures the parent cannot be unloaded as long as it has any unloaded
   *   children.
   *
   * - The InodeMap stores raw (non-owning) pointers to the inodes.  When an
   *   Inode is unloaded we explicitly inform the InodeMap of the change.
   *
   * - Each TreeInode holds raw (non-owning) pointers to its children.  When an
   *   Inode is unloaded we explicitly reset its parent pointer to this object.
   *
   * - The numFsReferences_ variable tracks the number of users that know
   *   about this inode by its inode number.  However, this does not prevent us
   *   from destroying the Inode object.  We can unload the Inode object itself
   *   in this case, and InodeMap will retain enough information to be able to
   *   re-create the Inode object later if this inode is looked up again.

   *
   * This variable can only be incremented when holding either the parent
   * TreeInode's contents_ lock or the InodeMap lock.  It can only be
   * decremented when holding both the parent TreeInode's contents_ lock and
   * the InodeMap lock.  When ptrAcquireCount_ drops to 0 it is safe to delete
   * the Inode.
   *
   * It isn't safe to delete the Inode purely based on ptrRefcount_ alone,
   * since ptrRefcount_ is decremented without holding any other locks.  It's
   * possible that thread A ptrRefcount_ drops to 0 and then thread B
   * immediately increments ptrRefcount_ back to 1.  If thread B then drops the
   * refcount back to 0 we need to make sure that only one of thread A and
   * thread B try to destroy the inode.
   *
   * By tracking ptrRefcount_ and ptrAcquireCount_ separately we allow
   * ptrRefcount_ to be manipulated with a single atomic operation in most
   * cases (when not transitioning between 0 and 1).  Only when transitioning
   * from 0 to 1 or vice-versa do we need to acquire additional locks and
   * perform more synchronization.
