 * tracebus for which an ActivityBuffer subscribes to and stores events from.
 *
 * An inode materialization specifically refers to when a new version of
 * an inode's contents are saved in the overlay while before they referred
 * directly to a source control object. The duration we count for an inode
 * materialization consists of any time spent preparing/collecting file data,
 * writing the data to EdenFS's overlay, and materializing any parent inodes.
 *
 * An inode load refers to fetching state for the inode to store into memory.
 * Note: this is not the same as fetching data content for the inode. Fetching
 * data content from an hg BackingStore in particular is an HgImportTraceEvent.
 *
 * Note, path could be the full path (in the case of inode creations), or,
 * more commonly, just base filenames depending on how much is easily
 * available during the inode event.
