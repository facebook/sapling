   * mountPath -
   *      the absolute path to the mount point on disk.
   * threadPool -
   *      the thread pool to use for processing FUSE requests. Note this is not
   *      used to read fuse requests, but the processing that is not run on
   *      another thread pool in EdenFS is run here.
   * numThreads -
   *      the number of worker threads to read fuse requests off the fuseDevice.
   * dispatcher -
   *      once parsed requests are passed off to the dispatcher for handling,
   *      this is the connection to the rest of EdenFS.
   * straceLogger -
   *      a logger to use for logging strace/syscall like events.
   * processInfoCache -
   *      a cache of client process information (pid, command line, parent,
   * etc). fsEventLogger - legacy telemetry on filesystem access.
   * structuredLogger -
   *      This is a logger for error events. Inside a Meta environment, these
   *      events are exported off the machine this EdenFS instance is running
   * on. This is where you log anomalous things that you want to monitor across
   * the fleet. requestTimeout - internal timeout for how long the FuseChannel
   * will give the lower levels of EdenFS to process an event. ETIMEDOUT will be
   * returned to the kernel if a request exceeds this amount of time. notifier -
   *      used to flag abnormal EdenFS behavior to users.
   * caseSensitive -
   *      whether or not the mount is case sensitive.
   * requireUtf8Path -
   *      whether the mount requires utf-8 compliant paths.
   * maximumBackgroundRequests -
   *      The max number of background requests the kernel will send. The
   *      libfuse documentation says this only applies to background requests
   *      like readahead prefetches and direct I/O, but we have empirically
   *      observed that, on Linux, without setting this value, `rg -j 200`
   *      limits the number of active FUSE requests to 16.
   * maximumInFlightRequests -
   *      The max number of in-flight requests that EdenFS will process at once.
   *      New requests will block when this limit is reached and will wait until
   *      existing requests until existing requests complete. When set to zero,
   *      no rate limiting will be enforced.
   * highFuseRequestsLogInterval -
   *      How often to log when we see a high number of in-flight FUSE requests.
   *      This is used to prevent us from spamming data to scuba.
   * useWriteBackCache -
   *      Fuse may complete writes while they are cached in kernel before they
   *      are written to EdenFS.
   * fuseTraceBusCapacity -
   *      The maximum number of FuseTraceEvents that can be buffered in the
   *      trace bus at any one time. This data feeds into `eden trace fs`.
