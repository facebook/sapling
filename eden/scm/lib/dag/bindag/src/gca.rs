/// GCA based on linear scan.
///
/// Ported from Mercurial's C code `find_gca_candidates()`.
///
/// The algorithm was written by Bryan O'Sullivan on 2013-04-16.
/// He provided both a Python [1] and a C version [2]. Since then, the only real
/// logic change is removing an unnecessary "if" branch by Mads Kiilerich on
/// 2014-02-24 [4].
///
/// The C implementation is quite competitive among linear algorithms on
/// performance. It is cache-efficient, has fast paths to exit early, and
/// takes up to 62 (if bitmask is u64) revs at once. Other implementations
/// might just take 2 revs at most. For example, the older implementation
/// by Olivia Mackall in 2006 [3] takes 2 revs explicitly.
///
/// Changes in this Rust implementation:
/// - Change `bitmask` from `u64` to `u8` for smaller memory footage, at the
///   cost of losing support for more than 6 revs.
/// - Support octopus merge.
