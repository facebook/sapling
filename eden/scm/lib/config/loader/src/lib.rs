//! `configloader` is about how to load config locally and remotely for a repo.
//!
//! It is heavyweight because of the remote config logic. There are lightweight
//! choices if you do not need logic to load configs, for example, if you can
//! just get a config from elsewhere.
//!
//! If you're looking for just reading configs, use `&dyn configmodel::Config`.
//! If you're looking for reading configs and some extra features like setting
//! configs, use `configset::ConfigSet`.
