description = """
    Cross platform client for subscribing to Commit Cloud eventsource (http server-sent events)
    The workflow is the following:
    * define 'subscription' as a unique [repo_name, workspace] pair
    * read set of 'subscribers', defined as [repo_name, workspace, repo_root]
    * runs a Commit Cloud eventsource listener in a separate thread for every 'subscription'
        (and a set of 'subscribers' (repo_roots))
    * triggers `hg cloud sync` command on notifications in all 'subscribers' (repo_roots)
        for a given 'subscription'
    * the library also contains a module to find OAuth token,
        this logic should be in sync with `hg cloud auth` command.
