//! backingstore - The crate provides backing store interface for EdenFS.
//!
//! This crate aims to provide EdenFS's backing store interface so EdenFS could use types in this
//! crate to import SCM blobs and trees directly from Mercurial's data store.
//!
//! The C++ code in `c_api` directory encapsulate Rust functions exposed from this crate into
//! regular C++ classes.
