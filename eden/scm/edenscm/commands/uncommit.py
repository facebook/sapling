"""uncommit part or all of a local changeset (EXPERIMENTAL)

This command undoes the effect of a local commit, returning the affected
files to their uncommitted state. This means that files modified, added or
removed in the changeset will be left unchanged, and so will remain modified,
added and removed in the working directory.

    """uncommit part or all of the current commit

    Reverse the effects of an :prog:`commit` operation. When run with no
    arguments, hides the current commit and checks out the parent commit,
    but does not revert the state of the working copy. Changes that were
    contained in the uncommitted commit become pending changes in the
    working copy.

    :prog:`uncommit` cannot be run on commits that have children. In
    other words, you cannot uncommit a commit in the middle of a
    stack. Similarly, by default, you cannot run :prog:`uncommit` if
    there are pending changes in the working copy.

    You can selectively uncommit files from the current commit by optionally
    specifying a list of files to remove. The specified files are removed from
    the list of changed files in the current commit, but are not modified on
    disk, so they appear as pending changes in the working copy.

    .. note::

       Running :prog:`uncommit` is similar to running :prog:`undo --keep`
       immediately after :prog:`commit`. However, unlike :prog:`undo`, which can
       only undo a commit if it was the last operation you performed,
       :prog:`uncommit` can uncommit any draft commit in the graph that does
       not have children.
