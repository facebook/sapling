    EdenApi Uploads API consists of the following:

        * Endpoint for lookup any type of data (file contents, hg filenodes,  hg treemanifests, hg commits).
        * Endpoint for upload file contents.
        * Endpoint for upload hg filenodes.
        * Endpoint for upload hg treemanifest.
        * Endpoint for upload hg commits & mutation information.

    The upload process is split into several stages:

        * Check and skip commits that have been already uploaded building ``uploadcommitqueue``.
        * Check and skip hg filenodes that have been already uploaded buiding ``uploadblobqueue``.
        * Check and skip hg trees that have been already uploaded buiding ``uploadtreesqueue``.
        * Calculate ContentIds hashes and upload all file contents for the ``uploadblobqueue``
          but skipping already uploaded content ids first (this step also deduplicates content ids
          if they are the same for some filenodes). See edenapi.uploadfiles.
        * Upload hg filenodes (``uploadblobqueue``).
        * Upload hg trees (``uploadtreesqueue``).
        * Finally, upload hg changesets and hg mutation information (``uploadcommitqueue``).

    If ``force`` is True (the default is False) the lookup check isn't performed prior to upload for commits, filenodes and trees.
    It will be still performed for file contents.

    If ``skipknowncheck`` is True (the default is False) the lookup check isn't performed to filter out already uploaded commits.
    Assumed it is known already that they are missing on the server.
