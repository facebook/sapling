# Obsmarker syncing.
#
# To avoid lock interactions between transactions (which may add new obsmarkers)
# and sync (which wants to clear the obsmarkers), we use a two-stage process to
# sync obsmarkers.
#
# When a transaction completes, we append any new obsmarkers to the pending
# obsmarker file.  This is protected by the obsmarkers lock.
#
# When a sync operation starts, we transfer these obsmarkers to the syncing
# obsmarker file.  This transfer is also protected by the obsmarkers lock, but
# the transfer should be very quick as it's just moving a small amount of data.
#
# The sync process can upload the syncing obsmarkers at its leisure.  The
# syncing obsmarkers file is protected by the infinitepush backup lock.
