"""Improved HTTP/1.1 client library

This library contains an HTTPConnection which is similar to the one in
httplib, but has several additional features:

  * supports keepalives natively
  * uses select() to block for incoming data
  * notices when the server responds early to a request
  * implements ssl inline instead of in a different class
