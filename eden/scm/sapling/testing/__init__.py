The `testing` module provides support to run integration tests in .t format
without depending on external POSIX binaries such as `/bin/bash`.


Usage
=====

Via `hg debugruntest`:

    hg debugruntest test-foo.t test-bar.t ...

Via `run-tests.py`. Only tests with `#debugruntest-compatibile` will run
through this `testing` module:

    run-tests.py test-foo.t test-bar.t ...

Difference between `hg debugruntest` and `run-tests.py`:
- `run-tests.py` supports tests that require a real `bash`. Those tests
  might use `#require bash` so they can be skipped by `debugruntest`.
  See "Compatibility" below.
- `hg debugruntest` prints output mismatch per check in a streaming way,
  using hg's own diff format (with word diff coloring). `run-tests.py`
  prints mismatches per test file (diff between `.t` and `.t.err`).
- Both support `-i` for updating outputs. `hg debugruntest` does not
  show interactive prompts. Use `hg revert -i` afterwards to interactively
  select updated outputs.
- `hg debugruntest` can also run or update Python doctests.
- `hg debugruntest` supports extended .t syntax. See below.


Compatibility
=============

Tests passing with `run-tests.py` and a real `bash` can fail with
`hg debugruntest` in a few ways:

- Shell syntax.
  `testing.sh` could behave differently for minor things like escaping in
  heredoc, etc. Usually there is a way to change the code slightly to be
  compatible with `debugruntest` or both test runners.

- Shell builtins and coreutils.
  `testing.sh.stdlib` emulates a subset of shell builtins and coreutils in
  Python. This emulation is not complete and not intended to be full
  POSIX-complaint. Depending on the issue, it might make sense to extend the
  emulation or choose an alternative way to do things.

- External binaries.
  The shell emulation avoids implicit dependencies on external binaries by
  resetting `PATH` to not contain common paths like `/bin`. External binaries
  need to be explicitly `#require`-ed so they become available in both shell
  emulation and `PATH`.

- In-process `hg` and Python global side effects.
  For performance, the `testing.ext.hg` registers the shell command `hg` as an
  in-process function.  `uisetup()` per extension only runs once because
  "loaded" extensions won't be loaded again. Side effects in `uisetup()` could
  be unintentionally permanent (cannot disable by disabling the extension) or
  unintentionally lost (if uisetup() changes the `ui` that will be recreated
  for the next command).  Sometimes it's possible to track down the side
  effects and fix it by gating with config options. If the fix is non-obvious,
  `#inprocess-hg-incompatible` can make a test run `hg` as external process -
  trade performance for compatibility. `#inprocess-hg-incompatible` can be used
  together with `#chg-compatibile` to restore some performance using chg.
  `#inprocess-hg-incompatible` disables in-process shell emulation.
  Commands run by `ui.system` will use the real system shell.

- Python block `>>>` behavior is different.
  In `debugruntest` the block won't be treated as a shell heredoc so things
  like `$TESTTMP` won't be substituted. Like Python doctest, `debugruntest`
  uses `compile(mode='single')` so non-None expressions will be printed.
  Python side effects made by the `>>>` block in `debugruntest` affects the
  rest of test file.

- Output check is slightly different.
  In `debugruntest` trailing blank lines are ignored. This could make
  `hg log -G` tests cleaner.


Extended .t syntax
==================

- Indented blocks.
  `$` and `>>>` blocks can have more than 2 spaces indentation.

- Hybrid Python block.
  Python block can be used with 4-space indentation. Inside the Python block
  regular `$` and `>>>` blocks can be used. This can be helpful to express
  things that are harder for bash.
  If unsure about how this works, check `__pycache__/ttest/test-name.py` for
  generated Python code transformed from `.t` source.


Internals
=========

Modules
-------

`testing` has a few modules:

- `sh`: bash interpreter
- `t`: `.t` runner
- `ext`: extensions for optional setup in `.t` tests


Bash interpreter
----------------

The bash interpreter uses `conch_parser` to convert bash code to AST and
interprets the AST. It tries to abstract real OS side effects away (ex. do
not use `os.environ` or `os.chdir`, or `open` directly unless told).

`types.Env` defines the "environment" state to run scripts. `stdlib` contains
shell builtins and common utilities.

`types.ShellFS` abstracts the filesystem. `OSFS` integrates with a real FS.
`TestFS` keeps files in-memory for side-effect-free testing.

If you modify the shell interpreter or the stdlib, consider adding a doctest
to `__init__.py`.


.t runner
---------

There are multiple steps to run a `.t` test:
- Translate `.t` to Python code. This is mainly done in `transform.py`.
  The translated result is written to `__pycache__/ttest/<name>.py` for easier
  debugging.
- Setup test environment. This is done by `runtime.TestTmp`. See its docstring
  for how to add new shell functions or affect the shell environments.
- Extends `TestTmp` for optional features. See "Extensions" below.
- Compare output. Output cannot be compared directly. For example, the test
  path is substituted to `$TESTTMP`, and Certain text like `(glob)`, `(?)`,
  `(no-windows !)` have special meanings. Text substitution is done by
  `TestTmp`. Special text is handled by `diff.py`.
- Feature detection for things like `#require symlink`. This is currently
  handled in `hghave.py`.
- Auto-fix. This is done by `runner.fixmismatches`.

`runner.py` contains logic to put things together.

`runner.TestRunner` manages multiple processes to run tests (so each test has a
clean Python state from start), and streams test events (ex. single output
mismatch, exception, test file pass) as Python objects to its caller.
`TestRunner` does not print anything and it's up to the caller to decide how to
output. Python stdlib `multiprocessing` provides IPC - child and parent process
communicate using Python objects. The call graph looks like:

    debugruntest                (pid 100, handle events and print to stdout)
      \_ runner.TestRunner      (pid 100, stream test events without output)
          |- runner._spawnmain  (pid 101, collect test result and report)
          |   \_ runner.runtest (pid 101, run test-1.t)
          |- runner._spawnmain  (pid 102, collect test result and report)
          |   \_ runner.runtest (pid 102, run test-2.t)
          :                     (more processes to run tests in parallel)

When using `run-tests.py`, child process management is done by `run-tests.py`
instead of `runner.TestRunner`. IPC uses CLI args, exit code, and filesystem
(write `.err` files). The call/process graph looks like:

    run-tests.py                (pid 100, tid 100)
      |- DebugRunTestTest.run   (pid 100, tid 101)
      |  \_ python -m sapling.testing.single test-1.t -o test-1.t.err (pid 101)
      |      \_ runner.runtest  (pid 101, run test-1.t)
      |- DebugRunTestTest.run   (pid 100, tid 102)
      |  \_ python -m sapling.testing.single test-2.t -o test-2.t.err (pid 102)
      |      \_ runner.runtest  (pid 102, run test-2.t)
      :                         (more processes to run tests in parallel)


Extensions
----------

Sapling tests were the main motivation to create `testing`. But the general
`.t` format seems useful beyond just Sapling use-cases. So the shell
interpreter and the `.t` runner are designed to not couple with Sapling.
For example, `testing.t`:
- Does not depend on anything in `sapling`.
- Does not set test environment variables like `HGUSER`.
- Does not handle business-logic related syntaxes like `#chg-compatible`.

However, for Sapling tests there are needs for setting `HGUSER`, respecting
`#chg-compatible`, providing the right `hg` command, etc. This is done by
the `testing.ext.hg` extension.

An extension can have a `testsetup(t: TestTmp)` entry point to change the
`TestTmp`. It can register functions (ex. `hg`), set environment variables,
and do other setups allowed by Python.

An extension does not have to be under the `testing.ext` module. It can be any
importable Python module living in other places outside `sapling`. This could
be useful for using the testing module to test other (CLI) tools.
