    In the event of a failure, *ideally* we would close or delete the

    tricky do here because:

    403 If creating a PR for the issue is forbidden, closing it probably is, too.

    Though https://github.com/facebook/sapling/issues/371 revealed that some
    repos opt to disable GitHub issues. Enabling issues should not be a
    requirement for creating pull requests, so the "placeholder issue" scheme is
    a non-starter for such repos.

    TODO: Figure out some sort of error-recovery scheme. Note that
