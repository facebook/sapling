# extorder.py - dependencies for extensions
"""
loading order for extensions.

In the extorder section of your hgrc you can define order of extension loading.
For example:

  [extorder]
  extension1 = extension3, extension4
  extension2 = extension1

This will cause the extension1 to be loaded after 3 and 4. Also extension2 will
be loaded after extension1.

Also there are two special configs in this section: 'preferlast' and
'preferfirst'. Those are lists of extensions which prefer to be loaded first or
last. But these are not guaranteed -- normal dependencies have higher priority.

Please not that this extension modifies only order of loading extensions. It
will not load them for you
