       using rollback or extensions that destroy/modify history (amend,
       rebase, etc.) can cause considerable confusion with shared
       clones. In particular, if two shared clones are both updated to
       the same changeset, and one of them destroys that changeset
       with rollback, the other clone will suddenly stop working: all
       operations will fail with "abort: working directory has unknown
       parent". The only known workaround is to use debugsetparents on
       the broken clone to reset it to a changeset that still exists.
