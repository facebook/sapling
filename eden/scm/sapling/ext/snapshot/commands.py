    The --continuation-of option allows you to continue from a previous
    snapshot, reusing the same ephemeral storage and extending its TTL. This is
    useful for creating a series of related snapshots that share the same
    storage. Note that Source Control ephemeral storage is internally called "ephemeral bubble".

    Lifetime Management:
      Extends the TTL of ephemeral storage when using '--continuation-of'.
      The lifetime remains unchanged if the duration specified via --lifetime
        is shorter than the current remaining lifetime.
      If no --lifetime is provided, the lifetime resets to the greater of the
        default lifetime or the remaining lifetime.
      Returns an error if the storage has expired.

    Exits with code 2 if the file count in the snapshot will exceed max-file-
    count.

    This command compares the current working copy state against a previously

    Include/Exclude Pattern Behavior:
      When using -I (include) or -X (exclude) patterns, the comparison applies
      the same filtering to BOTH the working copy and the snapshot files.

      For example:
        hg snapshot isworkingcopy SNAPSHOT_ID -X '*.tmp'

      This ignores all .tmp files when comparing, regardless of whether the
      original snapshot included .tmp files or not. The patterns control
      which files are considered for the comparison, not which files the
      snapshot should have contained.

    This allows you to check working copy equivalence while ignoring certain
    file types (e.g., temporary files, build artifacts) that may have been
    present when the snapshot was created.
