# dirsync.py - keep two directories synchronized at commit time
"""
keep directories in a repo synchronized (DEPRECATED)

Configure it by adding the following config options to your .hg/hgrc or
.hgdirsync in the root of the repo::

    [dirsync]
    projectX.dir1 = path/to/dir1
    projectX.dir2 = path/dir2

The configs are of the form "group.name = path-to-dir". Every config entry with
the same `group` will be mirrored amongst each other. The `name` is just used to
separate them and is not used anywhere. The `path` is the path to the directory
from the repo root. It must be a directory, but it doesn't matter if you specify
the trailing '/' or not.

Multiple mirror groups can be specified at once, and you can mirror between an
arbitrary number of directories::

    [dirsync]
    projectX.dir1 = path/to/dir1
    projectX.dir2 = path/dir2
    projectY.dir1 = otherpath/dir1
    projectY.dir2 = foo/bar
    projectY.dir3 = foo/goo/hoo

If you wish to exclude a subdirectory from being synced, for every rule in a group,
create a rule for the subdirectory and prefix it with "exclude":

        [dirsync]
        projectX.dir1 = dir1/foo
        exclude.projectX.dir1 = dir1/foo/bar
        projectX.dir2 = dir2/dir1/foo
        exclude.projectX.dir2 = dir2/dir1/foo/bar
