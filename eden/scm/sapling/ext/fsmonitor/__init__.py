"""faster status operations with the Watchman file monitor (EXPERIMENTAL)

Integrates the file-watching program Watchman with Mercurial to produce faster
status results.

On a particular Linux system, for a real-world repository with over 400,000
files hosted on ext4, vanilla `@prog@ status` takes 1.3 seconds. On the same
system, with fsmonitor it takes about 0.3 seconds.

fsmonitor requires no configuration -- it will tell Watchman about your
repository as necessary. You'll need to install Watchman from
https://facebook.github.io/watchman/ and make sure it is in your PATH.

fsmonitor is incompatible with the largefiles and eol extensions, and
will disable itself if any of those are active.

The following configuration options exist:

::

    [fsmonitor]
    mode = {off, on}

When `mode = off`, fsmonitor will disable itself (similar to not loading the
extension at all). When `mode = on`, fsmonitor will be enabled (the default).

::

    [fsmonitor]
    timeout = (float)

A value, in seconds, that determines how long fsmonitor will wait for Watchman
to return results. Defaults to 10.0.

::

    [fsmonitor]
    blacklistusers = (list of userids)

A list of usernames for which fsmonitor will disable itself altogether.

::

    [fsmonitor]
    warn_when_unused = (boolean)

Whether to print a warning during certain operations when fsmonitor would be
beneficial to performance but isn't enabled.

::

    [fsmonitor]
    warn_update_file_count = (integer)

If ``warn_when_unused`` is set and fsmonitor isn't enabled, a warning will
be printed during working directory updates if this many files will be
created.

::

    [fsmonitor]
    sockpath = (string)

Posix only: path of unix domain socket to communicate with watchman
The path can contain %i that have to be replaced with user's unix username

::

    [fsmonitor]
    track-ignore-files = (boolean)

If set to True, fsmonitor will track ignored files in treestate. This behaves
more correctly if files get unignored, or added to the sparse profile, at the
cost of slowing down status command. Turning it off would make things faster,
at the cast of removing files from ignore patterns (or adding files to sparse
profiles) won't be detected automatically. (default: True)

::

    [fsmonitor]
    watchman-changed-file-threshold = 200

Number of possibly changed files returned by watchman to force a write to
treestate. Set this to a small value updates treestate more frequently,
leading to better performance, at the cost of disk usage. Set this to a large
value would update treestate less frequently, with the downside that
performance might regress in some cases. (default: 200)

::

    [fsmonitor]
    dirstate-nonnormal-file-threshold = 200

Number of nonnormal files to force obtaining the wlock to update treestate.
Usually status will skip updating treestate if it cannot obtain the wlock,
in some cases that can cause performance issues. This setting allows
status to wait to obtain the wlock to avoid such issues. (default: 200)

::

    [fsmonitor]
    warn-fresh-instance = false

If set to true, warn about fresh instance cases that might slow down
operations.

::

    [fsmonitor]
    fallback-on-watchman-exception = (boolean)

If set to true then it will fallback on the vanilla algorithms for detecting
the state of the working copy. Note that no fallback results in transforming
failures from watchman (or timeouts) in hard failures for the current
operation. (default = true)

::

    [fsmonitor]
    watchman-query-lock = (boolean)

If set to true then take a lock when running watchman queries to avoid
overloading watchman.

::
    [fsmonitor]
    wait-full-crawl = true

If set, wait for watchman to complete a full crawl before performing queries.
"""

# Platforms Supported
# ===================
#
# **Linux:** *Stable*. Watchman and fsmonitor are both known to work reliably,
#   even under severe loads.
#
# **Mac OS X:** *Stable*. The Mercurial test suite passes with fsmonitor
#   turned on, on case-insensitive HFS+. There has been a reasonable amount of
#   user testing under normal loads.
#
# **Solaris, BSD:** *Alpha*. watchman and fsmonitor are believed to work, but
#   very little testing has been done.
#
# **Windows:** *Alpha*. Not in a release version of watchman or fsmonitor yet.
#
# Known Issues
# ============
#
# * fsmonitor will disable itself if any of the following extensions are
#   enabled: largefiles, inotify, eol.
# * fsmonitor will produce incorrect results if nested repos exist.
#   *Workaround*: add nested repo paths to your `.gitignore`.
#
# The issues related to nested repos are probably not fundamental
# ones. Patches to fix them are welcome.
