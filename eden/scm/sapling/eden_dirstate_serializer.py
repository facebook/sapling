    # The serialization format of the dirstate is as follows:
    # - The first 40 bytes are the hashes of the two parent pointers.
    # - The next 4 bytes are the version number of the format.
    # - The next section is the dirstate tuples. Each dirstate tuple is
    #   represented as follows:
    #   - The first byte is '\x01'.
    #   - The second byte represents the status. It is the ASCII value of
    #     'n', 'm', 'r', 'a', '?', as appropriate.
    #   - The next four bytes are an unsigned integer representing mode_t.
    #   - The seventh byte (which is signed) represents the merge state:
    #     - 0 is NotApplicable
    #     - -1 is BothParents
    #     - -2 is OtherParent
    #   - The next two bytes are an unsigned short representing the length of
    #     the path, in bytes.
    #   - The bytes of the path itself. Note that a path cannot contain \0.
    # - The next section is the copymap. Each entry in the copymap is
    #   represented as follows.
    #   - The first byte is '\x02'.
    #   - An unsigned short (two bytes) representing the length, followed by
    #     that number of bytes, which constitutes the relative path name of the
    #     *destination* of the copy.
    #   - An unsigned short (two bytes) representing the length, followed by
    #     that number of bytes, which constitutes the relative path name of the
    #     *source* of the copy.
    # - The last section is the checksum. Although the other tuples can be
    #   interleaved or reordered without issue, the checksum must come last.
    #   The checksum is a function of all of the bytes written up to this point
    #   plus the \xFF header for the checksum section.
    #   - The first byte is '\xFF' to distinguish it from the other fields.
    #   - Because we use SHA-256 as the hash algorithm for the checksum, the
    #     remaining 32 bytes are used for the hash.
