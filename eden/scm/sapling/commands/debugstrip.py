    """strip commits and all their descendants from the repository

    The debugstrip command removes the specified commits and all their
    descendants. If the working directory has uncommitted changes, the
    operation is aborted unless the --force flag is supplied, in which
    case changes will be discarded.

    If a parent of the working directory is stripped, then the working
    directory will automatically be updated to the most recent
    available ancestor of the stripped parent after the operation
    completes.

    Any stripped commits are stored in ``.hg/strip-backup`` as a
    bundle (see :prog:`help bundle` and :prog:`help unbundle`). They can
    be restored by running :prog:`unbundle .hg/strip-backup/BUNDLE`,
    where BUNDLE is the bundle file created by the strip. Note that
    the local revision numbers will in general be different after the
    restore.

    Use the --no-backup option to discard the backup bundle once the
    operation completes.

    Strip is not a history-rewriting operation and can be used on
    commits in the public phase. But if the stripped commits have
    been pushed to a remote repository you will likely pull them again.

    Return 0 on success.
