    Delete all untracked files in your working copy. Untracked files are files
    that are unknown to @Product@. They are marked with "?" when you run
    :prog:`status`.

    By default, :prog:`clean` implies ``--files``, so only untracked
    files are deleted. If you add ``--ignored``, ignored files are also
    deleted. If you add ``--dirs``, empty directories are deleted and
    ``--files`` is no longer implied.

    If directories are given on the command line, only files in these
    directories are considered.

    Caution: :prog:`clean` is irreversible. To avoid accidents, first
    perform a dry run with :prog:`clean --print`.
