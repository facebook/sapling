    """A structure to store and serialize/deserialize replay-related data

    Replay is a process of re-application of an `unbundle`, captured on
    the wire in some other system. Such re-application might have some
    expectations, which we need to be able to verify, and some additional
    data, which we may need to use. Currently, the following are stored:
      `commitdates` - a map form the original hash to the commit date to
                      be used in a rebased commit. Must be in the format,
                      understood by `util.parsedate`.
     - `ontobook` - a bookmark, used for pushrebase
     - `rebasedhead`- an expected hash of the rebased head
     - `hgbonsaimapping` - mapping from hg changesets to bonsai changesets.
                           Normally it's used only by mononoke
