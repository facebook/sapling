  Using Additional Features
  """""""""""""""""""""""""
  
      Mercurial has the ability to add new features through the use of
      extensions. Extensions may add new commands, add options to existing
      commands, change the default behavior of commands, or implement hooks.
  
      To enable the "foo" extension, either shipped with Mercurial or in the
      Python search path, create an entry for it in your configuration file,
      like this:
  
        [extensions]
        foo =
  
      You may also specify the full path to an extension:
  
        [extensions]
        myfeature = ~/.ext/myfeature.py
  
      See 'hg help config' for more information on configuration files.
  
      Extensions are not loaded by default for a variety of reasons: they can
      increase startup overhead; they may be meant for advanced usage only; they
      may provide potentially dangerous abilities (such as letting you destroy
      or modify history); they might not be ready for prime time; or they may
      alter some usual behaviors of stock Mercurial. It is thus up to the user
      to activate extensions as needed.
  
      To explicitly disable an extension enabled in a configuration file of
      broader scope, prepend its path with !:
  
        [extensions]
        # disabling extension bar residing in /path/to/extension/bar.py
        bar = !/path/to/extension/bar.py
        # ditto, but no path was supplied for extension baz
        baz = !

  aliases: d
  
  show differences between commits
  
      Show the differences between two commits. If only one commit is specified,
      show the differences between the specified commit and your working copy.
      If no commits are specified, show your pending changes.
  
      Specify "-c" to see the changes in the specified commit relative to its
      parent.
  
      By default, this command skips binary files. To override this behavior,
      specify "-a" to include binary files in the diff.
  
      By default, diffs are shown using the unified diff format. Specify "-g" to
      generate diffs in the git extended diff format. For more information, see
      'hg help diffs'.
  
      Note:
         'hg diff' might generate unexpected results during merges because it
         defaults to comparing against your working copy's first parent commit
         if no commits are specified.
  
      Returns 0 on success.
  
  Options ([+] can be repeated):
  
   -r --rev REV [+]         revision
   -c --change REV          change made by revision
   -a --text                treat all files as text

      --nodates             omit dates from diff headers
      --noprefix            omit a/ and b/ prefixes from filenames
   -p --show-function       show which function each change is in
      --reverse             produce a diff that undoes the changes
   -w --ignore-all-space    ignore white space when comparing lines
   -b --ignore-space-change ignore changes in the amount of white space
   -B --ignore-blank-lines  ignore changes whose lines are all blank
   -Z --ignore-space-at-eol ignore changes in whitespace at EOL

      --only-files-in-revs  only show changes for files modified in the
                            requested revisions

  (some details hidden, use --verbose to show complete help)

  $ hg help status
  hg status [OPTION]... [FILE]...
  
  aliases: st
  
  list files with pending changes
  
      Show status of files in the working copy using the following status
      indicators:
  
        M = modified
        A = added
        R = removed
        C = clean
        ! = missing (deleted by a non-hg command, but still tracked)
        ? = not tracked
        I = ignored
          = origin of the previous file (with --copies)
  
      By default, shows files that have been modified, added, removed, deleted,
      or that are unknown (corresponding to the options "-mardu", respectively).
      Files that are unmodified, ignored, or the source of a copy/move operation
      are not listed.
  
      To control the exact statuses that are shown, specify the relevant flags
      (like "-rd" to show only files that are removed or deleted). Additionally,
      specify "-q/--quiet" to hide both unknown and ignored files.
  
      To show the status of specific files, provide a list of files to match. To
      include or exclude files using patterns or filesets, use "-I" or "-X".
  
      If "--rev" is specified and only one revision is given, it is used as the
      base revision. If two revisions are given, the differences between them
      are shown. The "--change" option can also be used as a shortcut to list
      the changed files of a revision from its first parent.
  
      Note:
         'hg status' might appear to disagree with 'hg diff' if permissions have
         changed or a merge has occurred, because the standard diff format does
         not report permission changes and 'hg diff' only reports changes
         relative to one merge parent.
  
      Returns 0 on success.
  
  Options ([+] can be repeated):
  
   -A --all                 show status of all files
   -m --modified            show only modified files
   -a --added               show only added files
   -r --removed             show only removed files
   -d --deleted             show only deleted (but tracked) files
   -c --clean               show only files without changes
   -u --unknown             show only unknown (not tracked) files
   -i --ignored             show only ignored files
   -n --no-status           hide status prefix
   -C --copies              show source of copied files
   -0 --print0              end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs
      --rev REV [+]         show difference from revision
      --change REV          list the changed files of a revision
      --root-relative       show status relative to root
   -I --include PATTERN [+] include files matching the given patterns
   -X --exclude PATTERN [+] exclude files matching the given patterns

  $ hg help dates
  Date Formats
  """"""""""""
  
      Some commands allow the user to specify a date, e.g.:
  
      - backout, commit, import, tag: Specify the commit date.
      - log, revert, update: Select revision(s) by date.
  
      Many date formats are valid. Here are some examples:
  
      - "Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006" (local timezone assumed)
      - "Dec 6 13:18 -0600" (year assumed, time offset provided)
      - "Dec 6 13:18 UTC" (UTC and GMT are aliases for +0000)
      - "Dec 6" (midnight)
      - "13:18" (today assumed)
      - "3:39" (3:39AM assumed)
      - "3:39pm" (15:39)
      - "2006-12-06 13:18:29" (ISO 8601 format)
      - "2006-12-6 13:18"
      - "2006-12-6"
      - "12-6"
      - "12/6"
      - "12/6/6" (Dec 6 2006)
      - "today" (midnight)
      - "yesterday" (midnight)
      - "now" - right now
  
      Lastly, there is Mercurial's internal format:
  
      - "1165411109 0" (Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006 UTC)
  
      This is the internal representation format for dates. The first number is
      the number of seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 00:00 UTC). The second
      is the offset of the local timezone, in seconds west of UTC (negative if
      the timezone is east of UTC).
  
      The log command also accepts date ranges:
  
      - "<DATE" - at or before a given date/time
      - ">DATE" - on or after a given date/time
      - "DATE to DATE" - a date range, inclusive
      - "-DAYS" - within a given number of days of today

Test section lookup

  $ hg help revset.merge
      "merge()"
        Changeset is a merge changeset.
  
  $ hg help glossary.dag
      DAG
          The repository of changesets of a distributed version control system
          (DVCS) can be described as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), consisting
          of nodes and edges, where nodes correspond to changesets and edges
          imply a parent -> child relation. This graph can be visualized by
          graphical tools such as 'hg log --graph'. In Mercurial, the DAG is
          limited by the requirement for children to have at most two parents.
  

  $ hg help hgrc.paths
      "paths"
      -------
  
      Assigns symbolic names and behavior to repositories.
  
      Options are symbolic names defining the URL or directory that is the
      location of the repository. Example:
  
        [paths]
        my_server = https://example.com/my_repo
        local_path = /home/me/repo
  
      These symbolic names can be used from the command line. To pull from
      "my_server": 'hg pull my_server'. To push to "local_path": 'hg push
      local_path'.
  
      Options containing colons (":") denote sub-options that can influence
      behavior for that specific path. Example:
  
        [paths]
        my_server = https://example.com/my_path
        my_server:pushurl = ssh://example.com/my_path
  
      The following sub-options can be defined:
  
      "pushurl"
         The URL to use for push operations. If not defined, the location
         defined by the path's main entry is used.
  
      "pushrev"
         A revset defining which revisions to push by default.
  
         When 'hg push' is executed without a "-r" argument, the revset defined
         by this sub-option is evaluated to determine what to push.
  
         For example, a value of "." will push the working directory's revision
         by default.
  
         Revsets specifying bookmarks will not result in the bookmark being
         pushed.
  
      The following special named paths exist:
  
      "default"
         The URL or directory to use when no source or remote is specified.
  
         'hg clone' will automatically define this path to the location the
         repository was cloned from.
  
      "default-push"
         (deprecated) The URL or directory for the default 'hg push' location.
         "default:pushurl" should be used instead.

Test section lookup by translated message

str.lower() instead of encoding.lower(str) on translated message might
make message meaningless, because some encoding uses 0x41(A) - 0x5a(Z)
as the second or later byte of multi-byte character.

For example, "\x8bL\x98^" (translation of "record" in ja_JP.cp932)
contains 0x4c (L). str.lower() replaces 0x4c(L) by 0x6c(l) and this
replacement makes message meaningless.

This tests that section lookup by translated string isn't broken by
such str.lower().

  $ $PYTHON <<EOF
  > def escape(s):
  >     return ''.join('\\\u%x' % ord(uc) for uc in s.decode('cp932'))
  > # translation of "record" in ja_JP.cp932
  > upper = b"\x8bL\x98^"
  > # str.lower()-ed section name should be treated as different one
  > lower = b"\x8bl\x98^"
  > with open('ambiguous.py', 'w') as fp:
  >     fp.write("""# ambiguous section names in ja_JP.cp932

Test dynamic list of merge tools only shows up once
  $ hg help merge-tools
  Merge Tools
  """""""""""
  
      To merge files Mercurial uses merge tools.
  
      A merge tool combines two different versions of a file into a merged file.
      Merge tools are given the two files and the greatest common ancestor of
      the two file versions, so they can determine the changes made on both
      branches.
  
      Merge tools are used both for 'hg resolve', 'hg merge', 'hg update', 'hg
      backout' and in several extensions.
  
      Usually, the merge tool tries to automatically reconcile the files by
      combining all non-overlapping changes that occurred separately in the two
      different evolutions of the same initial base file. Furthermore, some
      interactive merge programs make it easier to manually resolve conflicting
      merges, either in a graphical way, or by inserting some conflict markers.
      Mercurial does not include any interactive merge programs but relies on
      external tools for that.
  
      Available merge tools
      =====================
  
      External merge tools and their properties are configured in the merge-
      tools configuration section - see hgrc(5) - but they can often just be
      named by their executable.
  
      A merge tool is generally usable if its executable can be found on the
      system and if it can handle the merge. The executable is found if it is an
      absolute or relative executable path or the name of an application in the
      executable search path. The tool is assumed to be able to handle the merge
      if it can handle symlinks if the file is a symlink, if it can handle
      binary files if the file is binary, and if a GUI is available if the tool
      requires a GUI.
  
      There are some internal merge tools which can be used. The internal merge
      tools are:
  
      ":dump"
        Creates three versions of the files to merge, containing the contents of
        local, other and base. These files can then be used to perform a merge
        manually. If the file to be merged is named "a.txt", these files will
        accordingly be named "a.txt.local", "a.txt.other" and "a.txt.base" and
        they will be placed in the same directory as "a.txt".
  
        This implies premerge. Therefore, files aren't dumped, if premerge runs
        successfully. Use :forcedump to forcibly write files out.
  
      ":fail"
        Rather than attempting to merge files that were modified on both
        branches, it marks them as unresolved. The resolve command must be used
        to resolve these conflicts.
  
      ":forcedump"
        Creates three versions of the files as same as :dump, but omits
        premerge.
  
      ":local"
        Uses the local 'p1()' version of files as the merged version.
  
      ":merge"
        Uses the internal non-interactive simple merge algorithm for merging
        files. It will fail if there are any conflicts and leave markers in the
        partially merged file. Markers will have two sections, one for each side
        of merge.
  
      ":merge-local"
        Like :merge, but resolve all conflicts non-interactively in favor of the
        local 'p1()' changes.
  
      ":merge-other"
        Like :merge, but resolve all conflicts non-interactively in favor of the
        other 'p2()' changes.
  
      ":merge3"
        Uses the internal non-interactive simple merge algorithm for merging
        files. It will fail if there are any conflicts and leave markers in the
        partially merged file. Marker will have three sections, one from each
        side of the merge and one for the base content.
  
      ":mergediff"
        Uses the internal non-interactive simple merge algorithm for merging
        files. It will fail if there are any conflicts and leave markers in the
        partially merged file. The marker will have two sections, one with the
        content from one side of the merge, and one with a diff from the base
        content to the content on the other side. (experimental)
  
      ":other"
        Uses the other 'p2()' version of files as the merged version.
  
      ":prompt"
        Asks the user which of the local 'p1()' or the other 'p2()' version to
        keep as the merged version.
  
      ":union"
        Uses the internal non-interactive simple merge algorithm for merging
        files. It will use both left and right sides for conflict regions. No
        markers are inserted.
  
      Internal tools are always available and do not require a GUI but will by
      default not handle symlinks or binary files.
  
      Choosing a merge tool
      =====================
  
      Mercurial uses these rules when deciding which merge tool to use:
  
      1. If a tool has been specified with the --tool option to merge or
         resolve, it is used.  If it is the name of a tool in the merge-tools
         configuration, its configuration is used. Otherwise the specified tool
         must be executable by the shell.
      2. If the "HGMERGE" environment variable is present, its value is used and
         must be executable by the shell.
      3. If the filename of the file to be merged matches any of the patterns in
         the merge-patterns configuration section, the first usable merge tool
         corresponding to a matching pattern is used. Here, binary capabilities
         of the merge tool are not considered.
      4. If ui.merge is set it will be considered next. If the value is not the
         name of a configured tool, the specified value is used and must be
         executable by the shell. Otherwise the named tool is used if it is
         usable.
      5. If any usable merge tools are present in the merge-tools configuration
         section, the one with the highest priority is used.
      6. If a program named "hgmerge" can be found on the system, it is used -
         but it will by default not be used for symlinks and binary files.
      7. If the file to be merged is not binary and is not a symlink, then
         internal ":merge" is used.
      8. Otherwise, ":prompt" is used.
  
      Note:
         After selecting a merge program, Mercurial will by default attempt to
         merge the files using a simple merge algorithm first. Only if it
         doesn't succeed because of conflicting changes will Mercurial actually
         execute the merge program. Whether to use the simple merge algorithm
         first can be controlled by the premerge setting of the merge tool.
         Premerge is enabled by default unless the file is binary or a symlink.
  
      See the merge-tools and ui sections of hgrc(5) for details on the
      configuration of merge tools.

Compression engines listed in `hg help bundlespec`

  $ hg help bundlespec | grep gzip
          "v1" bundles can only use the "gzip", "bzip2", and "none" compression
        An algorithm that produces smaller bundles than "gzip".
        This engine will likely produce smaller bundles than "gzip" but will be
      "gzip"
        better compression than "gzip". It also frequently yields better (?)
