        #
        #   3. The parent is now master (any prior parent
        #      commits were absorbed into master.)
        #
        #   4. The parent is totally disconnected, the history
        #      is bogus but at least the merge-base on master
        #      is the same or later.  (This can occur if you
        #      cherry-picked a commit out of an old stack and
        #      want to make it independent.)

        # maintain a consistent merge history between all PRs;
