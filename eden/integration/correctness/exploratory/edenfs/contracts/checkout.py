"""Checkout contracts: Thrift and `sl goto`, interruption, resume, refusal,
conflict counts, and the observations checkouts and status make.

The `source` cells record which revision a checkout started from: its
parent group, evaluated on the values just before it, marks the one
candidate the EdenFS parent held (or, while the `interrupted` cell names
an interrupted checkout to the same destination, that checkout's source: a
resume diffs against it). Every per-path group of a checkout that is not
settled requires that some mark of its own checkout is set. That orders
the parent move before every path change even when the destination is the
revision the checkout starts from, and ties an interrupted checkout's
paths to its start. When another checkout's parent move may land inside
the window, the group also requires the parent at its destination, which
serializes two checkouts to different revisions. No per-path group reads
the parent cell otherwise, so paths couple only through their own
checkout's marks. A per-path group reads its source from the mark; before
any mark exists every candidate's rows apply, so a path group never turns
into a no-op merely by running before its own parent group: FORCE to the
current revision still resets every path. Two checkouts may therefore both
apply, one after the other; no Exclusive is derived, because without
server timestamps no pair provably overlapped at the daemon. A `visit`
cell records that a checkout's per-path group has applied its path.

A checkout is settled (`_plans`) when every parent move that may precede
it is acked and ordered, so its source is one known revision, and no
other parent move, checkout, or aggregate observation overlaps its
window, and no attempt to the same revision that may have been
interrupted started before its window ends (it could resume into this
one): then nothing can read the parent between its parent group and
its paths, its groups read no mark, and no order requirement is
derived. Its paths then couple to nothing but their own path's actions.

A `conflict` cell records that an acked Thrift checkout reported a path
as conflicting: its per-path group marks it when the pre-visit state is
a conflict state, and one observation at the
checkout's completion, after every marking group, requires the marked
paths' weight to equal the recorded count (`count_inputs`). A write,
chmod, or unlink of a counted path is ordered by the engine against that
group: counted when it lands before the visit (kept by NORMAL, reset by
FORCE), not counted after it. A count whose
relevant paths include a type change, a path created with its parent
directory, or a directory the run moves is not derived: how EdenFS
types conflicts for those is not modeled (`_untyped`).

The `interrupted` cell names the checkout EdenFS holds interrupted. A
checkout's parent group, which only a checkout past the guard has, sets
it: to the checkout's own key when EdenFS reported its failure, else to
`absent`. A checkout that may have failed unreported (a transport error,
a client timeout) may set it to its key later (one optional group,
`_interruption_groups`). A resume is therefore possible only while the
cell names the resumed checkout, and a resume past the guard ends it.

A checkout the guard rejected records its would-be groups as
indeterminate, each requiring the impossible under the attempt's
`checkout.in-progress-rejection` obligation (`_rejected_groups`), and
one observation of what its message says (`rejection_observation`): the
interrupted advice needs an interrupted checkout to another target, the
in-progress text another checkout holding the guard. A failed status
says something about state too (`_status_observation`).

Checkout semantics, as EdenFS and Sapling behave on a live mount:

- A path is dirty when its bytes or its executable bit differ from the
  source entry (EdenFS compares the entry type).
- Thrift NORMAL applies a path only when it is clean or already equals
  the destination, and ignores Sapling's tracking.
- `sl goto` runs as Sapling runs it (`edenfs.rs:366-426`): a
  DRY_RUN visit per changed path marks whether its state blocks
  (`blocked`, per candidate source) and whether Sapling applies the path
  itself afterwards (`planned`: track an untracked copy of the
  destination); each NORMAL apply point uses
  the Thrift NORMAL table or the plan (read at the apply point when the
  visit has not run, so no order between them is needed) and, when the
  command succeeded, requires its visit to have run unblocked. A path blocks when
  it is dirty other than to the destination, untracked or added with
  other content, or absent (plainly unlinked or removed through
  Sapling) while the destination changes it. Any local change of a path
  the destination changes blocks; a dirty path it does not change is
  carried. An operation landing between a path's visit and its apply
  point is kept, with no abort.
- An aborting `sl goto` lists only paths that blocked
  (`abort_observations`).
  Every path an abort lists is relevant (`_context`), so its state is
  derived even when no action names it (a resume lists directories the
  interrupted walk removed).
- `.hg/updatestate` is a cell (`_updatestate_groups`): every `sl`
  checkout attempt deletes it, one that failed after DRY_RUN may leave
  its destination there, and `--continue` proceeds only when it names
  the continue's destination.
  The contract assumes Rust `cmdgoto`: its Python fallback (an
  unresolvable destination or mutation successors) starts only after
  that deletion.
- FORCE resets bytes and mode of every path either revision holds.
  `sl goto --clean` is FORCE without a DRY_RUN (`edenfs_force_checkout`);
  Sapling then forgets every path's tracking (`clear_edenfs_dirstate`),
  moves its parent like any `sl goto`, and never writes `.hg/updatestate`.
- A write or chmod overlapping a checkout may be superseded by it: it
  resolved the old inode before the swap and landed after it, so
  the cell it set ends at the destination's, with no conflict. An
  optional group per op, after the checkout has applied the path, resets
  only that op's cell; it exists wherever the checkout swaps the inode:
  under FORCE on every path either revision holds, changed or kept (the
  reported conflict is then optional), under NORMAL and `sl goto` on a
  path the destination changes.
- A path whose type changes takes its relevant descendants along: a new
  directory arrives with its children, and an old one is replaced only
  once its children are clean or gone. NORMAL keeps a directory with
  dirty or untracked children (DIRECTORY_NOT_EMPTY); FORCE also removes
  local-only children (`experimental:force-checkout-removes-local-only`,
  default true), which stays unencoded while validation refuses a path
  below a type-changing register. A directory replaced by a file is
  removed and the file bound in a second group, so the name may be
  absent in between (`_path_group`).

Interrupted checkouts apply each path independently: the per-directory
batch correlations EdenFS shows are not encoded, a sound
over-approximation. An interrupted `sl goto` may also apply its
DRY_RUN plan although Sapling's VFS step runs only after a successful
NORMAL checkout, another over-approximation.
