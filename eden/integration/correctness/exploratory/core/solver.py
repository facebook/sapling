"""The consistency engine: decides `semantics` per obligation within budgets.

Pipeline for one `Problem`:

1. Construction. Index every effect by the cell it writes (the
   interference index), name every obligation-bearing input (Agree is a
   direct check, never engine input), and compute the relevance closure:
   the cells observations and requirements read, closed under the guards
   and transfer sources of effects that write a relevant cell, and the
   groups that write a relevant cell, carry a requirement, are a
   precedence endpoint, or name an Exclusive variable. Every other cell
   and group is eliminated (lazy mode): an eliminated group writes only
   cells nothing reads and has no constraint, so it can always be placed
   at any point of its window (or dropped when indeterminate), and every
   lazy explanation extends to a full one. Initial values are queried
   only for relevant cells. An input whose relevance closure reaches a
   cell with no known initial value is not engine input: its obligations
   are not evaluated unless another input's proof violates them.
2. Factor graph. Union-find over relevant nodes joins: precedence
   endpoints, groups sharing an outcome variable, the groups of one
   Exclusive, and every reader (observation, requirement, guard, transfer
   source) with every writer of the read cell whose window lets it precede
   the reader. Footprints never join anything. `monolithic=True` joins
   everything (cross-check only).
3. Propagation per component: Exclusive over acked variables; precedence
   cycles and window infeasibility over always-happening nodes (earliest
   points along precedence edges); per-reader producer candidates (initial
   value, values of writers that may precede it, minus values a forced
   unguarded writer surely overwrites; a transfer contributes only the
   values its source can ever hold in the component) — a reader no
   candidate row can satisfy decides the component unsatisfiable without
   search, and so does a count (`effects.Count`) whose total lies outside
   what its cells must and may contribute (`_tally_readable`).
4. Finite choice without search: a component with no observation and no
   requirement is satisfied by dropping every indeterminate group. Every
   other component, however small, goes to the frontier search below.
5. Frontier search: just-in-time linearization over the component's nodes,
   memoizing failed states by (remaining nodes, values of cells a
   remaining node reads). Each sound reduction is documented where it is
   applied: dominating moves (forced placements, dead indeterminate
   groups), forward checking of every required check (a count by the
   bounds its cells' values and remaining writers allow), persistent sets
   seeded at the earliest deadlines, and restarts with new candidate
   orders on a Luby schedule that keep every failed state.

Results per obligation: a
satisfiable component satisfies its pending obligations. An unsatisfiable
one yields deletion sets over its inputs in `semantics.deletion_order`
(ID-free, latest evidence first): each candidate is tried once, deleted
when the rest stays unsatisfiable and necessary otherwise, so every set
is a minimal unsatisfiable subset and its obligations are violated with a
`ProofCertificate`; the set is removed and the component solved again.
Once the rest is satisfiable, for every proof and member, while the proof
minus that member plus every input not yet violated is unsatisfiable, its
deletion set is a new proof (`_Run._residual`); the others are
satisfied. The first explanation trial that runs out of budget stops the
component: proofs found so far stand, and every other input is not
evaluated. Budgets are per component (decision: 1/COMPONENT_SHARE of
DECISION_WORK; explanation: EXPLANATION_WORK), never what other
components left over. Without an account, every trial runs on the same
inputs at any budget until that point, so a larger budget only turns
not-evaluated into decided. With the check's history-wide account
(HISTORY_WORK), every meter also draws from it: once it is empty, what is
undecided is not evaluated with HISTORY_BUDGET, so a component's result
can then depend on what the components solved before it spent.
`eager=True` disables elimination (cross-check only).
