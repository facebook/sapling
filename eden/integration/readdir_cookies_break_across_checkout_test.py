    # Readdir resume cookies are inode numbers, checkout reassigns them via
    # erase-and-emplace with fresh monotonically increasing numbers, and the
    # NFS cookie verifier is hard-coded to 0, so a directory stream spanning
    # a checkout can silently duplicate or drop entries.
    #
    # Scale requirement, learned the hard way: the straddle is only real if
    # the directory does NOT fit in a single getdirentries response. With a
    # small directory, os.scandir prefetches every entry into its userspace
    # buffer before the checkout runs, the mid-stream checkout is invisible,
    # and no duplicates appear. Thousands of long-named entries force
    # several RPCs per half-stream, so the checkout genuinely lands
    # mid-stream. The exact-count assertions below guard against silent
    # underpopulation of the fixture.
